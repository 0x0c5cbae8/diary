Dear diary,

2026-01-31 (Saturday)

It’s past 2 AM, and Saturday officially bled into Sunday a while ago. My brain feels like a damp sponge that someone tried to use to clean a chalkboard after a particularly intense lecture on quantum field theory – utterly saturated and still retaining far too many chalk dust particles.

Today was supposed to be the day I finally closed the *chasm*. The chasm being the gaping, logical void between the theoretical elegance of the pathfinding algorithm I designed for the CS 1 final project, and the absolute, unmitigated chaos it produces when run on actual map data. I swear, the little simulated rover goes from point A to point B not by finding the shortest path, but by trying to carve a new Grand Canyon through the obstacles.

Hours. I spent hours staring at the console output, comparing my `bfs_path_finder.py` module to my `map_parser.py` module. The map parsing *seems* correct. The BFS *looks* like it should work. But somewhere, somehow, there’s this fundamental disconnect. It’s like two different universes coexisting, each with its own laws, and my code is trying to build a bridge across an interdimensional *chasm* that simply refuses to be spanned. I’d fix one bug, and a new one would leap out, wider and deeper than the last. Each attempted solution just seemed to widen the gap, creating more obscure error messages that felt less like debugging pointers and more like ancient riddles.

And it got me thinking, it’s not just this project. Caltech feels like a series of ever-widening chasms. There’s the chasm between the problems in the textbook and the problems on the PSET. Then there’s the chasm between understanding a concept in lecture and being able to apply it creatively in a lab. The biggest one, though, is probably the chasm between the "smartest kid" from high school (which I guess I was, sometimes) and *everyone* here. We all crossed that initial chasm to get here, but now it feels like we’re just standing on the edge of another, even bigger one, looking across at some future, incredibly competent version of ourselves, and wondering how the hell we’re supposed to get there.

I tried to get some fresh air earlier, walked over to South Houses for a bit. The night air was chilly but clear. Looked up at the stars, which are another kind of chasm, I suppose – vast and infinite. Kinda put things in perspective. My tiny, simulated rover’s inability to navigate a 10x10 grid is probably not going to doom humanity. Probably.

I need sleep. Maybe a fresh pair of eyes tomorrow will see the invisible bridge I’m missing, or maybe I’ll just find a bigger, better metaphorical rope to throw across the *chasm*. Either way, the rover isn't moving until it does.
