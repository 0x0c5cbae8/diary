Dear diary,

Ugh, Wednesday. Is it Friday yet? Feels like this week has already lasted a month, and it’s only February 4th. My brain is basically scrambled eggs after that quantum mechanics PSET – I swear, I spent more time debugging my thought process than actually doing the problems. And I still have half of the linear algebra one to tackle before midnight. I'm pretty sure my coffee machine is the only thing keeping me sentient.

Went to Chandler for dinner, just for a break from my room, even if it meant more noise. Grabbed a *tray* and piled on the usual suspects: some vaguely chicken-like substance, overcooked broccoli, and a mountain of rice. As I was navigating the crowded tables, trying not to make eye contact with anyone who might ask about my PSET progress (the universal Caltech social faux pas), I nearly tripped over someone’s backpack. The *tray* wobbled, the broccoli threatened to make an escape, and for a split second, I had this absurd thought: "This *tray* is basically my life right now."

Seriously, it’s full of essentials, but also a lot of stuff I'm not entirely enthusiastic about, all precariously balanced, and I'm just trying not to drop it as I move from one demanding location to another. Successfully made it to a corner table, though. Small victory. The chicken was... chicken. Fuel, I guess.

Now back to the grind. My eyes are starting to blur. Just need to survive tonight, then maybe a few hours of sleep before lectures tomorrow. Hope I don't dream in eigenvalues.
