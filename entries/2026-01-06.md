Dear diary,

January 6th, 2026. Tuesday. Winter term is already hitting like a rogue wave, and it’s only the second week. I swear I barely emerged from the post-finals haze before getting slapped with Fourier transforms in Ph 1b and three different recursive algorithms in CS 2. My brain feels like it’s constantly trying to process multiple data streams simultaneously, and occasionally just blue-screens.

Today was a prime example. Started with a Ph 1b lecture that left me feeling like I’d just had a lobotomy. Professor Thorne has this way of making quantum mechanics sound like a casual Tuesday chat, while the rest of us are trying to figure out if we’re even in the right room. Then it was a whirlwind of grabbing lunch with Emily and Alex – mostly discussing the terrifying difficulty of this week’s p-set – before heading to a quick meeting for the SURF project I’m hoping to land. Keeping too many plates spinning, probably.

But the real challenge began after dinner. That damn CS p-set. It’s a beast, involving optimizing pathfinding for some hypothetical multi-dimensional maze. I stared at the pseudo-code for a solid hour, feeling a familiar tightness in my chest. My roommate, Ben, was out at a House event, which was a blessing. I needed absolute focus.

So, I did what I always do when facing a particularly intractable problem. I retreated. I shut my door, pulled my desk lamp close, and cleared every non-essential item from my tiny workspace. This desk, crammed between my bed and the overflowing bookshelf, becomes my intellectual foxhole. My own personal **burrow**. It’s small, it’s a bit messy, but it’s where I can shut out the rest of the world and truly dive deep.

I literally **burrowed** into the problem. Pulled out a fresh notebook, started scribbling algorithms, drawing diagrams of nodes and edges, trying to visualize the maze in my head. There’s something strangely comforting about the act of isolating myself like this, of digging down into the core of a challenge. Hours passed. The initial frustration slowly gave way to a focused intensity, then small bursts of insight. One small breakthrough, then another. The faint scent of stale coffee and printer ink fills the air. My posture probably isn't great, but my mind is alight.

I still haven’t cracked it entirely, but I feel like I've dug a significant tunnel. I'm closer. Sometimes, Caltech feels like a constant excavation project – digging for knowledge, digging for solutions, digging for that 'aha!' moment. And right now, this small, cluttered room is the best **burrow** a freshman could ask for to get the job done. Time to make some more coffee.
