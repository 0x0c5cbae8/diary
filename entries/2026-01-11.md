Dear diary,

Another Sunday. Woke up late, or rather, *passed out* late after finally getting that simulation to run without crashing. My brain feels like a deflated balloon after all the caffeine and concentrated debugging.

The past 48 hours have been a blur of Visual Studio Code and Stack Overflow. I was banging my head against the wall trying to figure out why my agent-based model for my CS project kept throwing segmentation faults. It was supposed to simulate a basic ecological system, but all it was simulating was my increasing frustration. Every time I thought I had it, another obscure memory leak or pointer error would pop up.

Then, around 3 AM, fueled by cold pizza and the sheer terror of an impending deadline, I finally spotted it. A tiny, insidious off-by-one error in a loop that was causing an array index to go out of bounds under specific conditions. It was a single line, really, but its ripple effect was catastrophic. Implementing the **patch** felt like brain surgery. Just a minor tweak to the loop condition, changing a '<=' to a '<', but the relief was immense. The whole program finally ran smoothly, the little simulated organisms bustling around as intended.

It got me thinking, though. Caltech often feels like one big debugging session. You hit a "rough patch" with a concept in physics, then a "rough patch" with a problem set in math, and then you're trying to **patch** together a solution for a project that seems impossible. It's not just the code; it's everything. My sleep schedule, my social life (what social life?), even my room could use a good **patch-up** after all the late-night snacks and scattered notes.

Sometimes I wonder if I’m just a series of patches, constantly trying to fix the glitches in my understanding or my performance. But then, seeing that simulation run perfectly, after all that effort, there's a certain satisfaction to it. It makes you feel like you're actually building something, even if it's just a small, functioning piece of a much larger, more complex system.

Time to grab some actual food that isn't pizza and try to reset before the week begins. I need to figure out how to **patch** together a coherent plan for my Ma 1b problem set. This relentless cycle is exhausting, but I guess that's the Caltech way.
