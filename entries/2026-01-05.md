Dear diary,

It's 2 AM, Monday morphing into Tuesday, and I'm staring at a problem set for Ph 1. Again. Winter quarter just started, and it feels like I never even had a break. My brain feels like a damp sponge that someone wrung out yesterday and left to crust over. Professor Schmidt dropped this beast on us today, due Wednesday, and I swear he thinks we’re all sentient supercomputers. "A simple application of Lagrangian mechanics," he said. *Simple.* Right.

I just got up to stretch, my back protesting with a series of tiny pops. My fingers are stiff from writing equations, and my neck feels like it's been fused to my monitor for the past three hours. Honestly, I think my entire circulatory system has gone on strike. I can practically *feel* the sluggishness, like my **bloodflow** is just creeping along, refusing to deliver enough oxygen to my poor, beleaguered neurons. How am I supposed to derive the Euler-Lagrange equations for a double pendulum when my cognitive function is clearly hampered by inadequate perfusion? It’s a biological mystery how I’m still awake, let alone attempting to grasp these concepts.

I’ve had three cups of atrocious coffee from the house common room, and all it's done is make my eye twitch and my hands shake. No sudden bursts of intellectual clarity, no profound insights into generalized coordinates. Just a growing sense of existential dread mixed with caffeine jitters. Maybe I should try doing some jumping jacks? Get the heart rate up, force some fresh, oxygenated blood up to my cortex. It's either that or bang my head against the wall, which probably wouldn't improve the *bloodflow* to anywhere important anyway.

Just one more problem, I tell myself. Just one more. Then maybe I can collapse for a few hours before my 8 AM lab. At least in bio lab tomorrow we’re looking at actual, living cells, which hopefully have better **bloodflow** than I do right now.

Wish me luck, or at least wish my brain some better circulation.
