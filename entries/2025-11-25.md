Dear diary,

2025-11-25 (Tuesday)

Another Tuesday, another deluge of problem sets. Just spent the last three hours wrestling with Griffiths on a particularly gnarly EM problem, and then moved straight into Math 1b where I got completely stumped on a combinatorial probability question involving the *union* of several tricky events. My brain feels like it’s been put through a wringer. I swear, sometimes I stare at the symbol '∪' so long it just looks like a confused U.

Needed a break from staring at my dorm room walls, so I wandered over to the Red Door Cafe for a late-night coffee. Even at this hour, the place (which is basically our student *union*, right?) was buzzing. A mix of frantic studying, hushed conversations, and a few people just staring blankly into space, probably post-p-set exhaustion like me. It's almost Thanksgiving, and you can tell who's packing up to head home and who's settling in for a quiet campus holiday. There's a strange kind of *union* in that, I think. Even when we're all scattered, or some are celebrating while others are grinding, there's this underlying sense of being in it together, this unique Caltech experience that ties us all.

I saw a few guys from my House, and we chatted briefly about our plans. We're thinking of having a small "Friendsgiving" for those of us sticking around. It's funny, when I first got here, I felt pretty isolated, just another tiny cog in this massive, brilliant machine. But lately, especially with the House system, I'm starting to feel that sense of belonging, that *union* with a group of people who get it. We're all here for the same insane reasons, pushing ourselves to the limit, and relying on each other to keep sane. It’s a good feeling, actually.

Now, back to that probability question. Maybe a fresh perspective will help me untangle that *union* of events. Or maybe I'll just draw a Venn diagram so big it covers my entire whiteboard.
