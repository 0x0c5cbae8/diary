Dear diary,

Okay, maybe "diary" is a strong word. It’s more like a collection of scribbled thoughts I try to force onto the page once a week. Anyway, today was… interesting. Physics 12b is officially my nemesis. I'm pretty sure I spent the entire Lagrangian mechanics lecture drawing increasingly elaborate doodles of squirrels wielding tiny calculators. Professor Goodpaster caught me, too. He just sighed and said, "Mr. Chen, perhaps you’d find enlightenment in… reading ahead." Translation: You're doomed.

Speaking of doomed, I’ve been thinking a lot about the social dynamics here. Everyone’s so driven, so intensely focused on their research or problem sets, it’s almost… performative. I overheard a conversation at Chandler today about someone proudly boasting about only getting four hours of sleep. Like sleep deprivation is a badge of honor, a testament to their dedication! It feels like we're all willingly accepting a kind of intellectual servitude. We’re indentured to our coursework, chained to equations and theorems, all in the hopes of someday escaping… to more complex problems, I guess?

It’s not like I *hate* it. I actually love the challenge, the constant pushing. But there’s this nagging feeling that we’re sacrificing something valuable on the altar of academic achievement. Like, are we becoming *more* by becoming *less* human? I don’t know. Maybe I just need more sleep. And less squirrel art.

-Trevor
