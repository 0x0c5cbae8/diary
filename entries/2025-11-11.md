Dear diary,

Tuesday. November 11th, 2025. Another one for the books, or more accurately, another one for the ever-growing stack of problem sets on my desk. I swear, sometimes I feel like my entire existence revolves around the Olive Walk, a coffee cup, and the inside of an *auditorium*.

Today was particularly brutal. Physics 1c in Feynman. Professor Altschuler was on fire, blazing through Maxwell's equations like they were simple arithmetic. The whole *auditorium* was packed, the usual sea of tired, brilliant faces, all furiously scribbling notes in the dim light. I spent half the lecture alternating between genuine awe at the elegance of the math and a rising panic that I was missing three crucial steps in every derivation. My seat, a hard plastic one in the fifth row, felt like it was actively trying to absorb my will to live.

But then, there was this moment. Altschuler put up a diagram, some intricate field lines, and for just a second, it clicked. A tiny, fleeting moment of understanding amidst the chaos. It's like the entire collective intelligence of everyone in that *auditorium* just... vibrated. And for that split second, the discomfort, the sleep deprivation, the impending P-set deadline, it all faded. That's why I'm here, I guess. To sit in these hallowed *auditoriums* and try to grasp the universe, one impossibly complex equation at a time.

I probably look like a zombie, but I’ve got to tackle that wave mechanics problem. Maybe a few more hours and I can finally crash. Tomorrow's another day, another lecture, another *auditorium* waiting to either enlighten or confound me. Probably both.
