Dear diary,

December 27th, 2025. Saturday. And yes, it’s winter break, technically. Most of my friends are probably still in their pajamas watching terrible holiday movies, but here I am, still glued to my monitor in the dorm. Sleep? What's that? I swear, I think I'm starting to remember last night's dream in hexadecimal.

The bane of my existence right now is this stupid 3D rigging project. I’m trying to build a basic locomotion simulator for a hypothetical multi-limbed creature – thought it would be a cool demo for the Robotics Club next semester, and maybe I can adapt it for my CS 1 project. The core problem? The *skeleton*. Not the biological kind, though frankly, the math behind inverse kinematics feels just as complex as actual human anatomy. No, I mean the internal hierarchical structure that defines how the 3D model moves.

Getting the joints to articulate correctly, defining the parent-child relationships, ensuring the mesh deforms naturally around it without tearing – it’s a nightmare. I spent six hours today just trying to fix a bug where one of the creature's 'knees' would invert itself like some kind of Eldritch horror every time it took a step. It looked less like a walking simulation and more like a warning against messing with forbidden algorithms. The sheer precision required to get every bone and every vertex group just right, otherwise the whole thing collapses into a jumbled mess. It's like trying to build a bridge with toothpicks – the underlying *skeleton* has to be perfectly designed, or it all falls apart.

And honestly, after staring at wireframes and joint orientations for so long, I feel like my own physical *skeleton* is about ready to give up. My back is screaming, my eyes are dry, and I'm pretty sure my brain is just a loose collection of neurons firing off random Python snippets. I caught a glimpse of myself in the monitor reflection earlier, and I look like I've been sculpted out of coffee and pure academic anxiety. A walking, talking skeleton of a Caltech freshman.

But... it's also fascinating. The elegance of how a simple chain of bones, when given the right constraints and transformation matrices, can simulate such complex movement. It's the bare bones, the fundamental structure, that dictates everything else. Just like my courses, I guess – gotta master the *skeleton* of calculus or physics before you can build anything meaningful on top. Okay, one more coffee, then maybe I can tackle that quaternion rotation issue. Or maybe just stare blankly at the wall for a bit. The *skeleton* of my sanity demands a break.
