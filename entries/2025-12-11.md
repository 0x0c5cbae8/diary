Dear diary,

Thursday. My brain feels like a particularly deflated balloon that’s been run over by a truck. The week is nearly over, but the grind just keeps grinding. Physics 1a midterm grades came out today, and honestly, I think I completely *tanked* it. Not just "oh, that was hard" tanked, but "I might need to rethink my life choices" tanked. I spent so much time on that E&M stuff, doing extra problems, watching Kahn Academy videos until my eyes blurred, and still, when I saw the actual exam, my mind just went blank on a few key concepts. It felt like trying to grasp smoke. I tried to bluff my way through, to pull something out of the depths of my memory, but it was like my mental *tank* of knowledge just sprung a leak at the worst possible moment.

It’s just so frustrating, you know? I came here feeling so prepared, so ready for the challenge, and now it feels like every other week I’m questioning if I even belong. Everyone else seems to be cruising, or at least faking it better than me. Professor Albright just gave me a look that said, "Bless your heart, freshman," when I asked a follow-up question in lecture today, which didn't help. I need to figure out how to bounce back from this, because the final is looming, and I can't afford another performance like that. Maybe I need to try a different study group, or just lock myself in the library for 72 hours straight.

Okay, deep breaths. It's just one midterm. I still have time to pull things together. Gotta go, my Chem 1a problem set isn’t going to debug itself.
