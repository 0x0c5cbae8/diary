Dear diary,

It's Saturday, or at least that's what the calendar claims. My body and brain, however, are operating on a perpetual Monday, trapped in some sort of temporal loop where weekends cease to exist as a concept of rest.

I spent the entire day locked in my dorm room (okay, a brief, desperate dash to Chandler Dining Hall for sustenance), wrestling with the Physics 1a Homer. "Homer," what an ironic name for something that feels less like an epic journey and more like... well, like I'm bonded to a salt mine. Three hours just on problem 4. *Three hours*. My brain feels like it's been subjected to mental waterboarding. Each differential equation, each vector field, each attempt to deduce the behavior of a particle in an unfamiliar potential, feels like another chain being forged. This isn't merely learning; it’s a relentless form of academic servitude.

I literally missed the sunlight. Saw it briefly when I grabbed that sad-looking apple from the cafeteria. The thought of "free time" or "relaxing" feels like a cruel joke someone might play on a first-year. I remember high school weekends. *Remember* them. They seem like a mythological era now, filled with quaint notions of leisure and sleep.

Sometimes I wonder if this is what they meant when they said Caltech would be "challenging." It’s more than challenging; it's an all-consuming devotion, a kind of forced labor to the gods of STEM. My personal desires, my sleep, my fleeting wish to maybe, just maybe, play a video game for an hour... they're all secondary. My true master is the looming deadline, the unforgiving rubric, the sheer, crushing volume of material. I feel like a servant to the curriculum, bound to its every command.

And the worst part? A part of me still finds a sick sort of satisfaction when I finally *do* crack a problem. A tiny flicker of rebellion against the servitude, a brief moment of triumph before the next problem on the sheet drags me back down. I'm a willing slave, aren't I? Or perhaps just too stubborn to quit. The promise of understanding, of mastering these formidable concepts, is the ultimate bribe.

Anyway, I should probably try to get at least four hours of sleep tonight. The problem set isn't technically due until Monday morning, but who am I kidding? Sunday will be more of the same. The servitude continues.
