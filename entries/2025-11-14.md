Dear diary,

It's Friday, and honestly, it feels less like the end of the week and more like a brief intermission before the weekend's p-sets start their relentless assault. Just managed to submit the Ph 1a set – felt like I wrestled a very angry, quantum-mechanics-infused octopus for twelve hours straight. My brain is officially liquid.

But the real insult to injury today isn't theoretical physics, it's my foot. Specifically, my right heel. I swear, the amount of walking we do on this campus is insane. From my room in Lloyd to the lab in North Mudd, then to the library, then back, then to grab a quick (and probably cold) dinner from Chandler, all while rushing because time is a construct I no longer comprehend. My old sneakers finally gave up the ghost today, I think. Or rather, they decided to wage war on my epidermis.

By the time I limped back to my desk, it was a full-blown *blister*. A truly magnificent, quarter-sized bubble of misery, glowing ominously on my heel. It's ridiculous, isn't it? After all the complex systems, abstract proofs, and debugging that makes my eyes cross, the thing that's actually causing me the most immediate, tangible pain right now is a simple biological reaction to friction. It feels emblematic of life here – you're fighting these enormous, mind-bending battles, and then you get blindsided by something so utterly mundane, yet so disproportionately annoying. Like a single misplaced semicolon causing a cascade failure in a 1000-line code. This blister is my physical compiler error.

Now I'm contemplating how I'm going to manage walking to the next study session for CS 1. Or even just getting another coffee. Each step is a tiny, fiery reminder that even when your brain is soaring through multivariable calculus, your body can still betray you over something as primitive as footwear. I need to get some proper athletic tape or something tomorrow, but honestly, the thought of walking to Rite Aid feels like a marathon right now.

Maybe I'll just stay in and order some takeout. And apply a whole roll of toilet paper to my heel. Priorities, Trevor, priorities.
