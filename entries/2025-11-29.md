Dear diary,

Another Saturday, another P-set. This week it’s Physics 1c, and I swear quantum mechanics feels less like a subject and more like a cruel joke designed to make us question everything we thought we knew about reality. Spent most of the day in Fleming lounge, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the desperate hope that *this* time I’ll actually get the Hamiltonian for that particle in a box right on the first try. Spoilers: I didn't.

But amidst the endless equations and the hum of fluorescent lights, my mind kept drifting back to my latest obsession: my 3D-printed **formicarium** design. I know, I know, another "side project" when I should be studying, but honestly, it’s the only thing that keeps me sane sometimes. The sheer elegance of an ant colony's decentralized organization, the way they optimize foraging paths, manage waste, and defend their territory – it’s a living algorithm, a biological marvel of distributed computing. And I want to build the perfect habitat to observe it.

I'm trying to optimize the ventilation system for fungal control and temperature regulation, and I've been sketching out modular observation chambers with embedded humidity sensors. The material science alone is fascinating – what translucent polymer will allow for maximum light transmission without stressing the ants, while also being tough enough to withstand their tunneling? I even got into a debate with Kevin from down the hall about the ideal substrate for a *Messor barbarus* colony versus a *Lasius niger* one. He thinks I'm going overboard; I think he just hasn't seen the light yet.

It hit me while I was trying to debug my code for simulating the colony's foraging patterns. Caltech itself feels like a giant, slightly chaotic formicarium sometimes. We’re all scurrying around, following invisible pheromone trails of deadlines and problem sets, specializing in our own little niches (physics, CS, bioengineering), and constantly optimizing our routines for efficiency. We share resources (the library, the dining hall), communicate in complex ways (often via Discord or frantic late-night study sessions), and are driven by an underlying, almost instinctual, drive to build and discover.

And just like in my ideal formicarium design, there's an incredible amount of collective intelligence and tireless work happening. But maybe, unlike the ants, we occasionally get to sneak in a pizza run or spend a Saturday afternoon sketching out grand, slightly insane scientific projects that have nothing to do with our current classes.

I need to get some sleep. The formicarium can wait until tomorrow. The Hamiltonian, however, probably cannot.
