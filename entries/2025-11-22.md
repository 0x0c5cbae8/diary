Dear diary,

Another Saturday night, another "working" night. It’s 10 PM, and I just dragged myself back from the Lloyd common room, smelling faintly of laser-cut acrylic and desperation. Seriously, I thought Saturdays were for, you know, *not* doing p-sets? Apparently, that memo didn't reach Caltech freshmen.

Today was all about our "Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design" project. We're building this ridiculously over-engineered robotic snack dispenser (don't ask, it seemed like a good idea at the pitch meeting). My group's specific task was the front enclosure – a door that slides open and closed. Sounds simple, right? Nope. We decided to go for a tambour-style rolling door. You know, like an old rolltop desk, with all those thin slats that magically curve around a track.

"It'll be elegant!" I declared, optimistically, about three weeks ago. Now, I'm just watching the elegance collapse into a pile of jammed acrylic strips and shattered dreams. We laser-cut these beautiful matte black slats, designed a curving track in SolidWorks, and spent hours gluing tiny little canvas strips to the back to hold them together. In theory, it should roll smoothly around a tight curve and disappear into the dispenser's body. In reality, it just *jams*.

We tried tweaking the track radius. No luck. We sanded the edges of the slats for better clearance. Still binding. We even tried a different type of glue for the canvas backing, thinking it might be a stiffness issue. Nada. Every time one of us tries to demonstrate it, there’s this awful grinding sound, followed by a defeated sigh. It's like the universe itself is conspiring against the smooth, fluid motion of our tambour mechanism. How hard can it be for a piece of wood (or acrylic, in our case) to just *bend* and *slide*? I'm staring at the CAD model, then at the physical prototype, trying to find the discrepancy. Is it friction? Is it a tolerance stack-up? Did the laser cutter have a bad day and make our slots 0.001 inches too wide, or too narrow?

This is classic Caltech, isn't it? Take something seemingly mundane, like a desk door, and discover it's a profound engineering challenge with a dozen hidden variables. My brain feels like those jammed slats, grinding against itself. I just want to hear the satisfying *thunk* of it rolling freely, not the mournful squeak of it seizing up. My teammates are equally burnt out, but we’re all too stubborn to give up. We’ve committed to the tambour, and by golly, it *will* tambour. Eventually. Probably after another all-nighter with more precise sanding and a lot more caffeine.

I need sleep. Or maybe I just need to find an actual rolltop desk and stare at it, hoping for divine inspiration.
