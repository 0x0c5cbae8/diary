Dear diary,

Happy Thanksgiving, I guess? It feels a bit surreal. Instead of my mom's ridiculously dry turkey and my dad's endless stream of terrible jokes, I was at Professor Albright's house in San Marino, surrounded by her equally brilliant (and slightly intimidating) children and a couple of other stray international students. They were incredibly nice, though. Her cranberry sauce actually tasted like cranberries, not just sugar.

But even with the pie and the genuinely engaging conversation about the optimal gravitational parameters for a Mars colony (I told you, Caltech), my brain just wouldn't shut off. I found myself thinking about the final project for CS 1. It’s supposed to be a practical application of data structures, and our group is trying to build a resource allocation system for campus labs. The sheer number of variables, the constraints, the potential for deadlocks… it’s a mess. We had a mini-meeting yesterday, and the biggest point of contention was defining the *product* itself – not just the code, but the actual user experience, the tangible result someone interacting with it would get. How do you quantify "intuitive"?

Then, while helping Professor Albright's youngest untangle a particularly stubborn string of Christmas lights, my mind drifted to Physics 10. We just started on rotational dynamics, and the concept of torque, which is literally the *vector product* (or cross product) of the position vector and the force vector, just clicked into place in a way it hadn't during lecture. It's funny how a break, even a non-traditional one, can sometimes clear the academic cobwebs better than hours in the library.

I suppose my first semester here is the *product* of a lot of late nights, way too much coffee, and a constant feeling of being simultaneously overwhelmed and exhilarated. I'm not entirely sure what I'm becoming, but it's definitely a different Trevor than the one who arrived three months ago. Maybe a slightly more sleep-deprived, but definitely more intensely focused, *product*.
