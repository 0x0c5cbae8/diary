Dear diary,

December 30, 2025. Tuesday. Can't believe it's almost New Year's already. Winter break has been… an experience. It’s weird being home after a full term at Caltech. My parents are great, of course, but the sheer lack of constant intellectual stimulation here is almost jarring. No late-night problem sets, no impromptu whiteboarding sessions, no intense debates about the quantum implications of a particularly elegant proof, just… holiday cheer and endless reruns.

To fill the void and avoid succumbing to existential boredom, I finally started watching *Axiom Protocol*, that complex sci-fi series everyone on the Physics Discord kept raving about. I usually steer clear of anything with too much overt emotional drama – frankly, most human relationship dynamics are less predictable than chaotic systems and yield far fewer interesting analytical solutions. But the world-building is surprisingly robust, the theoretical physics they use is mostly sound (I even spotted a minor inconsistency in their FTL drive mechanics in episode 7, but I’ll let it slide), and the intricate political plot is genuinely engaging.

But here’s the thing, diary. I’ve stumbled into something I never anticipated. I've become a *shipper*.

Specifically, for Dr. Aris Thorne, the brilliant but emotionally guarded xenolinguist, and Captain Kaelen Vance, the daring, almost recklessly effective commander of the *Stardust Seeker*. I know, I know. Me. Trevor. The guy who once spent three hours optimizing the packing density of my laundry before a trip. But their dynamic… it’s just *compelling*. The way Dr. Thorne always finds a way to subtly support Captain Vance's leadership, providing crucial insights even when his own theories are ridiculed. And Vance, for all her stoicism and focus on mission parameters, clearly has a deep respect, bordering on admiration, for Thorne's often abstract, philosophical approach to alien communication.

I've spent an embarrassingly large amount of time scrolling through the *Axiom Protocol* subreddit, analyzing forum posts, dissecting their on-screen interactions. I've even started to mentally catalog the evidence: shared glances that linger just a fraction too long in moments of crisis, subtle shifts in posture when one is defending the other, their complementary problem-solving approaches that somehow always lead to a synergistic breakthrough. It’s like a complex proof, only instead of proving a mathematical theorem, I’m trying to prove the inevitability of their romantic entanglement. The emotional payoff if they finally *do* get together would be… significant. I think. My Caltech brain keeps trying to overlay probability distributions onto their interactions, calculating the likelihood of a confession based on observed data points and narrative foreshadowing.

It feels utterly illogical, this emotional investment in fictional characters. And yet, there’s a part of me, a distinctly non-academic part, that just *wants* it to happen. It's almost... relaxing, in a strange way, to engage with something so overtly emotional and subjective, far removed from the cold, hard logic of my classes. Maybe it's a necessary counter-balance to all the rigor.

I just hope no one from my dorm ever finds out about my deep dive into the Thorne/Vance 'ship. The irony would be too much to quantify.
