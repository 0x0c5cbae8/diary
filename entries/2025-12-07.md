Dear diary,

It's Sunday, December 7th, and the air here on campus already feels like a countdown to Christmas break, even if my brain is still firmly entrenched in the quantum weirdness of Physics 11. I just spent the last five hours wrestling with the final problem set – an absolute beast involving harmonic oscillators and perturbation theory. My fingers still feel phantom pains from furiously scribbling equations. I’m pretty sure the only thing that got me through was the promise of a decent dinner and the sheer, unadulterated terror of a B.

But that’s not really what’s on my mind tonight. Not entirely, anyway.

I went down to Fleming for dinner, mostly just to escape the four walls of my room in Dabney, and that’s when it happened again. She was there. Maya. From my Physics 11 lab section. She was at a table with some other sophomores, laughing about something someone said. And diary, I swear, when she laughs, it's like a perfectly tuned aural phenomenon. It's not loud, but it's utterly infectious.

And just like that, the entire carefully constructed mental fortress I build around myself to focus on academic pursuits… it all just *collapsed*. Every time I see her, it's this weird, almost chemical reaction in my chest. A *crush*, they call it. And it feels exactly like the word sounds – a sudden, overwhelming compression of all rational thought. My internal monologue goes from "Derive the expectation value for momentum" to "Is my hair doing that thing where it sticks up in the back? What if she saw me looking? Just act natural, Trevor, natural!"

It’s completely illogical. I’m a Caltech freshman. My primary directives should be 'Survive P-sets,' 'Secure decent sleep (optional),' and 'Understand the fundamental forces of the universe.' "Developing inexplicable physiological responses to a peer's smile" is definitely *not* on that list. And yet, here we are.

I managed to grab a quick plate and find a corner table, trying to look absorbed in my phone while secretly observing her with the precision of a telescope tracking a distant galaxy. She was explaining something to one of her friends, gesturing with her hands, and even from across the room, you could tell she understood the concept inside and out. That's the part that really gets me, I think. She's not just smart; she’s got this incredible way of making complex ideas sound elegant. It’s like watching a beautifully executed proof.

The whole encounter just... *crushed* my ability to think about anything else for the rest of the evening. I tried to review the solutions for a problem from last week’s Math 1a, but my brain kept replaying the image of her laughing. How am I supposed to achieve intellectual enlightenment when my neural pathways are constantly rerouting to contemplate social interactions I’m too awkward to initiate?

I mean, what's the optimal approach here? Is there a peer-reviewed methodology for expressing interest without sounding like I’m proposing a joint research project on the socio-emotional impact of unrequited affection? Probably not. I just feel… overwhelmed by the sheer irrationality of it all. It’s like trying to model chaotic systems without knowing the initial conditions.

Right. Time to pull myself together. There’s still that fluids P-set for Aero due on Tuesday, and I can't let a "crush" completely derail my GPA. But I just needed to get it out.
