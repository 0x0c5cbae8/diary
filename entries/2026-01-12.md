Dear diary,

The fluorescent hum of the library is starting to feel like a second heartbeat. It's only Monday, and already I'm drowning in p-sets. Ma 1a, Ph 1a... they're like two separate black holes, each pulling me in with its own gravitational force of complex integrals and quantum mechanics. But honestly, the math and physics aren't even what's really grinding my gears today.

We had our weekly CS 1 group meeting this afternoon for the final project. You'd think that five Caltech students would be able to collaborate efficiently, right? Apparently, you haven't met Mark from Dabney. I swear, he makes every meeting an exercise in passive-aggressive intellectual sparring. Today was particularly bad. He dismissed literally every suggestion, including a pretty solid one from Jenny, with a derisive sniff and then launched into a monologue about his 'superior' approach. He even called my proposed algorithm 'quaint' – *quaint*!

I don't know if he just lacks basic social skills or genuinely enjoys making other people feel small, but he acted like a complete *lout*. Just a boorish, uncouth presence, radiating an air of self-importance that's utterly suffocating. It makes me want to abandon the group entirely and just submit my own code, even if it means doing five times the work. It’s hard enough figuring out how to balance these classes without having to navigate the treacherous waters of someone else’s ego. I just wanted to get our state machine diagram approved, not endure a masterclass in how to be an insufferable jerk.

Anyway, back to Ma 1a. That last problem isn't going to solve itself, and Mark certainly isn't going to help.
