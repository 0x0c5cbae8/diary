Dear diary,

December 1st, 2025. Monday. Is it really December already? My brain feels like it’s been put through a quantum entanglement experiment, all scrambled and fuzzy. That p-set for Ph 1a was brutal. Seriously, finding the eigenvalues for a system with *that* many degrees of freedom on only four hours of sleep feels like a violation of the laws of thermodynamics. But it’s in, thank god. Probably got half of it wrong, but at this point, half feels like a victory.

I swear, my existence here is just a cycle of problem sets, lukewarm coffee, and the constant hum of my dorm-mates furiously typing. And today, to cap off the Monday madness, we had that mandatory "Pathways to Innovation" talk in the Beckman **Auditorium** this afternoon. I almost fell asleep right there in my seat, the dark, cavernous space and the droning voice of Dr. Aris Papanikolaou (no offense to him, he seemed brilliant, but I was running on fumes) nearly pulled me under.

It’s funny, sitting in that massive hall, looking around at all the other bleary-eyed freshmen and upperclassmen, I kept thinking about the sheer weight of expectation in that room. Every one of us, a future Nobel laureate, a groundbreaking engineer, a revolutionary scientist, or so the story goes. And right now, all I felt was the crushing weight of tomorrow’s Ma 1b midterm. The speaker was talking about some revolutionary new material science application, and while a part of my brain was genuinely fascinated, the other 90% was mentally deriving Taylor series expansions for a particularly nasty calc problem.

Yet, even amidst the exhaustion, there's something about being in that space, surrounded by so much raw intellect and ambition. It’s intimidating, sure, but also incredibly motivating. It makes the p-sets, the late nights, the constant feeling of being slightly behind, feel… worth it? Almost. I mean, it’s not every day you get to fall asleep (almost) in the same *auditorium* where actual Nobel laureates give their talks. Small victories, I guess.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think my bed is calling my name. Or maybe it’s just the sound of my brain cells dying. Either way, sleep. Definitely sleep.
