Dear diary,

Another Wednesday, another mountain of problem sets. I swear, Quantum Mechanics 101’s PSets are specifically designed by some mischievous elder gods to break the spirits of mere mortals. I’ve been wrestling with a particular perturbation theory problem for three hours, and it feels like my brain is slowly turning into cold oatmeal. My roommate, Ben, is already asleep, probably dreaming in differential equations. Lucky guy.

I took a break and just stared at the wall, feeling utterly minuscule. That’s when my mind drifted, as it often does when I’m about to give up, to the sheer, overwhelming brilliance of the people who *figured this stuff out* in the first place. You know, our intellectual **forebears**. I mean, imagine being Schrödinger, grappling with wave functions from scratch, without a textbook, without anyone to ask for a hint. Or Feynman, who not only understood it but could explain it in a way that makes me feel simultaneously enlightened and profoundly stupid for not seeing it immediately.

We had a history of science snippet in my PHYS 11 intro lecture today, about Millikan and the early days of Caltech. He wasn't just building a university; he was building a launchpad for future discoveries, setting the stage for all of us. Every equation I scratch out, every line of code I debug, I'm standing on the shoulders of these giants. It's humbling, to say the least. Sometimes it’s crushing, honestly. Like, how can I ever contribute anything meaningful when so much has been done by such incredible **forebears**?

But then I try to flip it. It's also incredibly inspiring. It means the path has been blazed, and it's our turn to try and push the boundaries a little further, to ask the next set of questions. It's why I came here, right? To be part of that lineage, even if I'm just a tiny, struggling freshman. I guess it’s a privilege, even when it feels like a cosmic punishment.

Okay, deep breath. Time to tackle that perturbation theory problem again. Maybe if I channel the spirit of some tenacious Caltech **forebear**, I'll finally get it. Or at least get close enough to earn some partial credit. The grind continues.
