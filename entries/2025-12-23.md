Dear diary,

December 23, 2025. Tuesday.

Finally breathing. The P-sets were brutal, but I made it out of finals alive. The sheer relief is almost a physical sensation. Now, for the first time in weeks, I can actually work on my *own* projects for fun without feeling guilty about procrastinating on organic chem.

Today was dedicated to my latest pet endeavor: resurrecting this ancient weather station data logger I pulled from a dusty corner of the EE basement. It looked like something straight out of a Cold War bunker – all chunky beige plastic and green LEDs. I figured it'd be a cool challenge to get it talking to a modern system.

Everything was going relatively smoothly – I managed to desolder some corroded capacitors and even got the internal clock chip to re-sync. But then I hit the data transfer. It's got one of those really old RS-232 serial ports, and turns out, its 'network' interface is basically an internal *modem* designed for dial-up. A full-on, acoustic-coupler-era, squawk-and-whistle *modem*. My attempts to connect it felt like trying to translate Latin for a Martian.

I swear I spent half the day just wrestling with baud rates and trying to get a virtual serial port to properly handshaker. And then digging into the AT command set – for a *modem*! I even tried to emulate one in software for a bit just to understand the precise dance of the carrier tones. It felt like I was debugging something straight out of an RFC from the '80s, before IP over Avian Carriers was even a meme. Why, oh why, couldn't they have just used Ethernet? Or even something slightly less archaic?

But you know what? When that first stream of raw, unparsed weather data finally flickered across my terminal, even at a blistering (for 1995) 2400 baud, it was such a rush. It's wild how the core ideas of signal modulation and error correction, the very heart of what a *modem* does, are still just as relevant today, even if they're buried under so many layers of abstraction in modern protocols. It makes you appreciate the foundational brilliance behind it all. Who knew a relic like a *modem* would be my post-finals brain teaser, reminding me why I came to Caltech in the first place?

Time to maybe get some actual sleep tonight. Or perhaps try to parse that data stream. We'll see.
