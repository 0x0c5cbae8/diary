Dear diary,

2026-02-06, Friday.

What a week. Just submitted the beastly Ma 1 P-set. My brain feels like it’s been put through a centrifuge, then reassembled by a toddler. The relief is palpable, like finally closing a circuit after debugging a really stubborn breadboard. I was just about to reward myself with some YouTube deep dives into quantum field theory (don't judge, it's my Friday night equivalent of Netflix) when Alex burst in.

He looked like he’d just seen a ghost, or worse, failed a midterm. He was pacing, muttering something about "the incident" and "prime suspects." Turns out, the house's sacred, communal bag of artisanal, free-range (probably) granola disappeared from the kitchen cupboard sometime between 7 PM and 8 PM. And Alex, apparently, was spotted loitering suspiciously close to the kitchen at exactly 7:37 PM, just after finishing his laundry. The horror! The injustice!

"Trevor," he practically yelled, "you were here, right? You saw me? You can vouch for me?"

I blinked. I was, in fact, here. From about 6:30 PM until... well, until he burst in, I'd been holed up at my desk, deep in the algorithmic jungle of CS 1, trying to figure out why my linked list kept returning null pointers instead of sorting correctly. It was a brutal fight, spanning multiple hours and an alarming quantity of caffeinated beverages.

And then it clicked. "Yes, Alex," I said, pointing at my computer screen which still showed a glorious mess of Python, "I've been right here, attempting to establish the existential validity of my code. And you were here with me, at least until you went to get that extra large cup of coffee around 7:45 PM, complaining about the Ma 1 P-set."

He stopped pacing. "So… you were here, I was here... for most of the critical window of the granola vanishing?"

"Precisely," I confirmed, feeling a strange sense of satisfaction. "My dedicated, if ultimately futile, attempt to debug my code serves as your unimpeachable **alibi**. From 7 PM to 7:45 PM, you were either in this room, agonizing over your own assignments, or in my direct line of sight as you went for coffee. Therefore, you could not have simultaneously been executing the Great Granola Heist."

He slumped onto his bed, a dawning smile on his face. "So, I’m safe? You can tell them I was suffering with you?"

"I can provide a temporal-spatial exclusion statement," I clarified. "Your physical presence in our room, corroborated by my continuous observation and verifiable by the timestamp on my last code commit prior to your coffee run, places you unequivocally *not* at the scene of the alleged crime during the relevant interval. It's airtight."

Only at Caltech would a missing bag of granola necessitate such a rigorously constructed defense. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go document this for the record. For science. And for Alex's future snack-related legal defense.
