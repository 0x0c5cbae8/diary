Dear diary,

Wednesday. Just the word itself feels like a heavy rock in my stomach after a night that barely touched three hours of actual sleep. Pretty sure my brain cells are in a mass exodus at this point. I swear, the only thing keeping me upright through Physics 102 was the sheer terror of falling asleep and missing some critical quantum mechanics insight that I’ll need for the p-set.

Speaking of which, that p-set. I spent the last four hours in the lounge, fueled by questionable vending machine coffee and sheer desperation, trying to decipher Problem #7. It’s this multi-part monstrosity about particle tunneling through a ridiculously complex potential barrier, with about five different boundary conditions to consider, each one subtly contradicting the last. It’s not just hard; it feels *designed* to be frustrating, to break your spirit.

Honestly, it feels like this problem was conceived by some ancient, all-powerful ruler with too much time on their hands and a twisted sense of humor. Like some *sultan* decreed, "Let them solve *this*! Let them prove their worth by untangling this impossible knot of equations, for only those worthy of my royal court shall pass!" And here I am, a mere freshman, trying to appease the theoretical physics *sultan* who crafted this digital labyrinth. I kept staring at the white board, imagining a stern-faced figure in flowing robes, stroking a long beard, chuckling at my suffering.

I made a tiny bit of progress, I think. Or maybe I just unlocked a new layer of confusion. Either way, it’s 2 AM, and I’m pretty sure the only thing more depleted than my energy reserves is my faith in a benevolent universe. I just want to understand why the potential well suddenly decides to become infinite at *that* specific point. What *whim* was that based on?

Gotta try and squeeze in another hour, then maybe crash for a bit before my 8 AM calc recitation. The grind is real.
