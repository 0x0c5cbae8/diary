Dear diary,

Sunday again. Another week has spun itself into a blurry, sleep-deprived *being*, and here I am, still processing the molecular chaos of it all. It’s 11 PM, and I'm supposed to be winding down, but my brain is currently *being* an uncooperative supercomputer trying to defragment a terabyte of P-set data.

Today was, predictably, a day of *being* holed up in the library. Ph 1c P-set 6 is a beast. Seriously, I’m pretty sure the final problem on quantum tunneling wasn’t just about calculating probabilities, but about questioning the very *being* of a stable electron. And by extension, my own sanity. Sometimes I wonder if these problems are designed to make us transcend our current state of *being* and achieve a higher plane of understanding, or just drive us straight into a caffeine-induced coma. Probably both.

I did manage to emerge briefly for food. Saw a couple of upperclassmen in Chandler looking absolutely exhausted, their eyes holding that familiar thousand-yard stare. It's a strange kind of comfort, *being* part of this collective experience of intellectual masochism. We're all human *beings*, after all, just ones who willingly sign up for this particular brand of delightful torment.

My room still looks like a tornado went through a textbook factory. I swear I'm *being* more organized this term, but then I blink, and suddenly there's a stack of unread papers threatening to avalanche onto my bed. My mom called earlier, asking how I was *being*. I told her "productive," which is technically true, even if "productive" here means existing in a perpetual state of problem-solving. I probably should have mentioned the part where I briefly considered if my own existence was merely a simulation, purely for the sake of avoiding the next step of the differential equations.

Honestly, the biggest challenge sometimes isn't the physics itself, but maintaining a reasonable level of *well-being* while immersed in it. Getting enough sleep, eating something besides Soylent and ramen, actually seeing sunlight. These things feel like luxuries. Yet, there’s a thrill in it, too. A sense of *being* on the edge of discovery, even if right now that discovery is just finding the right integration technique.

Tomorrow, the cycle continues. More lectures, more P-sets, more *being* Trevor, Caltech freshman. For now, I'm going to try to shut down my mental processors and attempt to achieve the enviable state of *being* asleep.
