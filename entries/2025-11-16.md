Dear diary,

November 16, 2025. Sunday.

Another weekend gone in a blur of caffeine and P-sets. It’s 11 PM and my brain feels like it’s been put through a quantum entanglement machine – all stretched and slightly broken. I spent most of today wrestling with the latest Discrete Math assignment. Specifically, problem 4c. It’s about probability and sets, and I just couldn't wrap my head around the concept of the *union* of three events. The notation itself started to look like some arcane spell, and every time I thought I had it, I’d find another edge case that contradicted my logic. *A union B union C*... my head was throbbing.

I tried for hours in my room, staring at the whiteboard, scribbling Venn diagrams that looked more like abstract art than actual set representations. The loneliness of the struggle was getting to me. I felt like I was drifting in a sea of unknown theorems, completely isolated.

Finally, around 7 PM, I threw my pen down in frustration and messaged Ben and Chloe from my House. "Help," I typed, "my brain is rejecting the concept of 'union'." They were, thankfully, in a similar state of existential dread over the same problem. We decided to meet up in the common room – our unofficial "student union" where the real work, and occasionally the real breakdown, happens.

It was such a relief to see them. Just the act of walking over there, knowing I wasn't alone in my struggle, already lightened the load. We sprawled out on the worn couches, surrounded by empty snack wrappers and textbooks. We started from scratch, pooling our collective confusion. Ben had a slightly different interpretation of the inclusion-exclusion principle, and Chloe pointed out a subtle detail in how the problem defined "overlapping" events. As we talked, argued, and drew on the communal whiteboard, something clicked. The jumbled pieces in my mind started to form a coherent picture. The *union* of our individual understandings began to clarify the mathematical *union* of those elusive sets.

It wasn't just about solving problem 4c. It was about the sense of solidarity, the feeling of our minds merging, even temporarily, to overcome a shared academic enemy. We formed our own little *union* right there, a temporary but vital alliance against the tyranny of the P-set. By the time we finally cracked it, a wave of relief washed over me. Not just for the problem being solved, but for the reminder that I'm part of something here, a community where people genuinely help each other.

Now, it's late, and I still have to shower before tomorrow's 8 AM lecture. But I feel a little less like a lone island and a lot more like a component of a larger, supportive set. Maybe that's what Caltech is really about, beyond the tough classes – finding your *union* with others.
