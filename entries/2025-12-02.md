Dear diary,

Tuesday. December 2nd. Is it just me, or does time at Caltech warp around finals like a black hole around a dying star? Today felt like three days squeezed into one, and yet, somehow, it’s already almost midnight. Another 14-hour grind, fueled by questionable coffee and a deeply ingrained fear of failure.

Thermodynamics p-set, due tomorrow, took a solid six hours out of my life. Then there was the lab report for Circuits, which involved trying to explain why our oscilloscope kept throwing a fit like a toddler denied candy. And let’s not even talk about trying to wrap my head around the 'Introduction to Quantum Mechanics' problem set that Professor Lee dropped on us today. It’s like he just plucked equations out of a different dimension and told us to make sense of them. My brain feels like it’s been put through a centrifuge.

Mid-afternoon, during a particularly brutal stretch of trying to debug my Python script for our data analysis project, I swear I just spaced out. My eyes glazed over, staring at the wall of my dorm room, and for a solid minute, I just imagined myself. Not here, not hunched over a laptop, but somewhere completely different. I pictured myself in some ridiculously opulent palace, lounging on silk cushions, being fanned by servants, with a never-ending supply of exotic fruits and maybe a pet falcon. Just pure, unadulterated leisure.

I just wanted to be a *sultan*. A sultan of absolutely nothing productive. No p-sets, no lectures, no deadlines, no impending doom of finals. Just... a sultan of chill. Can you imagine? The sheer, unadulterated luxury of having *no* responsibilities beyond deciding what flavor of sherbet to have next. It was such a vivid, ridiculous fantasy that it actually made me chuckle, which probably sounded insane to anyone walking past my door.

Then, of course, the cold, hard reality of my monitor's blue light snapped me back to Earth. Back to debugging, back to integrals, back to the Caltech grind. A sultan’s life, it seems, is on indefinite hold. At least until winter break. If I survive.

I should probably get a few more hours of sleep before my 8 AM lecture tomorrow. Or maybe just one more problem. The struggle is real.
