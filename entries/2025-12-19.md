Dear diary,

It's Friday, December 19th. The term is *finally* over. Or at least, my part of it is. Just submitted the last lab report for EE 10 – Basic Circuits – about five hours ago. I swear I can still smell solder in my hair, and I haven’t even been in the lab since Wednesday.

My brain is mush. I think I've slept a cumulative total of maybe 12 hours since Monday. But there's a weird, buzzing relief now, like when the high-pitched whine from a power supply finally cuts out. Pure, sweet silence.

The biggest bane of my existence this week, besides Kirchhoff's laws and the phantom short circuit that plagued my breadboard for three agonizing hours? The humble, yet utterly infuriating, **crocodile** clip. Seriously, I've developed a profound, almost existential hatred for those little serrated jaws. You'd think a simple clip would just *clip*, right? Wrong. These little metallic reptiles have a mind of their own. They'd either clamp down so hard they'd bend the component leads, or they'd be so loose they'd constantly lose connection, introducing noise into our already temperamental circuit.

I spent at least an hour just trying to get a stable signal from a function generator to an op-amp, all because one set of *crocodile* clips decided to go on strike. It felt like wrestling a tiny, uncooperative beast, trying to keep its flimsy teeth locked onto the correct point without shorting anything nearby. Every time I thought I had it, the waveform would jump, or flatline. It was a metaphor for this entire term, honestly. Just when you think you've got a handle on the problem, something small and seemingly insignificant, like a poorly designed clip, throws everything into chaos.

Anyway, it's done. And unlike actual crocodiles, these ones can be put back in a drawer and ignored for a few weeks. I’m packing tonight, catching a flight home tomorrow morning. All I want is a solid twelve hours of sleep and maybe to not think about a single current, voltage, or resistance for a month.

Caltech is… intense. But I made it through my first term. And hopefully, I’ll never have to wrestle a rogue crocodile clip for a grade ever again.
