Dear diary,

February 7, 2026. Another Saturday.

It’s 11 PM, and I’m pretty sure my brain just filed for divorce. I just barely finished the Phys 1b p-set – or at least, I convinced myself I did. My head feels like it’s been put through a particularly aggressive blender, and I'm pretty sure a few precious neurons have been permanently ejected from my skull. The concept of quantum tunneling, especially when you start factoring in energy barriers and time-dependent potentials, is less a theory and more an act of pure, unadulterated **violence** against everything my classical physics intuition holds dear.

I spent six hours in the Avery common room today, fueled by questionable coffee and sheer, raw desperation. There was a point around 4 PM where I stared at a particularly gnarly integral for so long that my vision blurred, and I nearly committed an act of violence against my poor mechanical pencil. It wasn't the equation itself, but the way it *mocked* me, daring me to find the elegant solution hidden within its chaotic variables. It felt like a direct assault on my mental fortitude, a subtle but persistent intellectual beating.

The workload here isn't just challenging; it's a relentless, subtle form of psychological violence. Every late night, every skipped meal, every moment of self-doubt whispered by a seemingly simple derivation... it chips away at you. You learn to embrace it, I guess. To find a strange, masochistic satisfaction in surviving the intellectual onslaught. But tonight, I just feel... battered.

I'm gonna try to get a solid five hours of sleep before starting on the Ma 1b vector calculus tomorrow. Hopefully, it’s less violent than today’s physics. Or at least, I'll be better equipped to withstand the assault. My brain cells deserve a momentary truce.
