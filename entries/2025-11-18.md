Dear diary,

November 18, 2025 (Tuesday)

Another Tuesday in the books, or more accurately, another Tuesday *on* the books – my textbooks, that is. Today felt like a marathon of mental gymnastics, starting with Calc 1a where Professor Schmidt spent an entire hour on the nuances of the *product rule* for differentiation. Honestly, I thought I had it down cold, but when he threw in those multi-variable implicit functions… let's just say my brain did a few cross *products* trying to keep up. My notebook looked like a crime scene of scribbled symbols and arrows by the end.

After that, it was straight to CS 1, where we had our weekly project check-in. My team is building this ridiculously ambitious dorm-room inventory management app – basically, trying to optimize space for all the random tech and junk we accumulate. It’s supposed to be a *product* that makes freshman life easier, but right now it feels like the *product* of all my stress. We hit a snag with the database integration, and I spent a good hour staring at my screen, willing the SQL queries to just *work*. Seeing a bug-free, functional *product* is the dream, but the journey to get there is a wild ride of debugging and caffeine. Max, my roommate, even joked that the only *product* of my coding session was a new level of existential dread.

The word "product" just kept echoing in my head all day. In Physics, we were talking about impulse and momentum, and how force applied over time is the *product* that changes an object's motion. Then, during dinner at Chandler, some upperclassmen were loudly debating the latest consumer electronics *products*, dissecting their specs and market strategies like it was a grand unified theory.

It makes me think about what I'm *producing* here at Caltech. Am I just absorbing information, or am I truly creating something? My p-sets are a *product* of my effort, sure, and my code is a *product* of my learning, but I hope to eventually make something bigger, something that genuinely solves a problem or changes things. Tonight, as I finally finished that impossibly long Calc p-set – which involved a truly devious problem about maximizing the *product* of two positive numbers given their sum – I felt a small victory. It’s a tiny *product* of a very long night, but it’s a *product* nonetheless.

Time for a few hours of sleep before tomorrow’s *product*ive endeavors.
