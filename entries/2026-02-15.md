Dear diary,

February 15th, 2026
Sunday

Woke up far too late, considering the mountain of work I still have to get through before classes tomorrow. My roommate, Alex, was already gone – probably in the lab wrestling with that perpetually finicky laser alignment for his SURF project. Meanwhile, I was still wrestling with my pillow, dreaming of caffeine.

The main culprit for my impending mental breakdown this weekend is the ME 2 problem set due tomorrow. Specifically, one problem. One *cursed* problem involving heat transfer through a **cone**. A solid, truncated cone, to be precise, with one base at a fixed temperature and the other radiating heat into the environment. Trying to calculate the steady-state temperature distribution felt less like engineering and more like an advanced form of torture.

I spent practically all of Saturday evening and a good chunk of today staring at that diagram. My whiteboard is a chaotic mess of cylindrical and spherical coordinates, partial derivatives, and boundary conditions that just wouldn't cooperate. I swear, my brain felt like it was being compressed into a tiny conical shape itself. I even took a break, walked to Chandler for dinner, and saw some upperclassmen trying to balance traffic cones on their heads outside the SAC. For a brief moment, I genuinely envied them; their cones seemed much simpler than mine.

Came back, fueled by ramen and a determination bordering on obsession. Stared at the problem again. Drank more coffee. And then, it just… clicked. A weird substitution I'd half-remembered from a tangential physics lecture, combined with a trick for handling the radiation boundary condition. Suddenly, the differential equation simplified, the Bessel functions (which I was *dreading*) weren't needed, and the integrals became… manageable.

The satisfaction of seeing that final expression, knowing it was correct, was almost euphoric. There's something uniquely Caltech about deriving a complicated formula for something as seemingly mundane as a cone and feeling like you've just solved the mysteries of the universe. For a solid hour, my little conical problem felt like the most important thing on Earth.

One down, but not out. Still have to finish the last two problems for ME 2, and then tackle the reading for tomorrow's quantum discussion. The grind never truly stops here. But at least, tonight, I conquered the cone. Now, if only I could figure out how to get more sleep…
