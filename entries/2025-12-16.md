Dear diary,

Tuesday, December 16, 2025

My brain feels like it’s been put through a P-set shredder. Ph 1a is really trying to break me. I just spent the last five hours wrestling with a particularly nasty problem on oscillating circuits and resonant frequencies, and I’m pretty sure I introduced a fundamental error somewhere in my calculations when I accidentally inverted a matrix in my head. Sleep is a distant, fuzzy memory, much like my high school GPA.

I had to step away. My eyes were blurring, and the numbers on the page were starting to look like an alien language. I stumbled out of my room, past the usual late-night drone of keyboards and hushed conversations, and just needed to breathe some actual, non-stale air. I ended up just wandering aimlessly for a bit, past the Millikan Pond, under the huge trees that line the walk.

And then I saw it – a little patch of something green, stubbornly thriving in a planter box near what I think is the geology building. It was some kind of succulent, all spiky and robust, shimmering slightly under the campus lights. My brain, usually occupied with vector fields and differential equations, surprisingly latched onto it. I found myself staring at it, thinking, "How does that *work*?"

It sounds ridiculous, I know, but after hours of trying to force electrons to behave, the sheer, effortless elegance of a plant suddenly hit me. Here’s this organism, completely self-sufficient, just sitting there, turning sunlight and dirt into… itself. No external power supply needed (beyond the sun). No complex algorithms to write; it just *grows*. How do its cells optimize water retention? How does it decide where to put new leaves to maximize light absorption? It’s an incredible biological system, an entirely different kind of engineering problem.

I actually pulled out my phone – probably should have been checking for email updates on the Ph 1a solutions, but no – and started looking up "botany, succulent, water retention." I got lost for a good twenty minutes reading about crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) and the geometry of rosettes. It's like the plant figured out how to write its own code for survival, perfectly adapted to its environment. The fractal-like patterns, the intricate internal structures for transport… it's all so incredibly optimized.

It wasn't just a distraction from my circuit woes; it was a moment of genuine, pure Caltech-style curiosity, but aimed at something completely outside my usual scope. This whole world of botany, which I’d always vaguely dismissed as "just plants," is teeming with complex systems, elegant solutions, and biological algorithms operating at a microscopic level. It's literally organic engineering at its finest.

Anyway, feeling slightly less fried now, strangely refreshed by thinking about photosynthesis instead of Kirchhoff’s laws. Wish my circuits were as robust and self-sustaining as a simple succulent. Maybe I should design a drone that can identify plant species with AI and predict their growth patterns… Okay, Trevor, focus. Back to the P-set. Only a few more hours until dawn.
