Dear diary,

January 23rd, 2026 (Friday)

Another Friday, another day questioning my own existence. Not in a dramatic, 'is this all a dream?' way, though honestly, after 48 hours running on espresso and the sheer terror of PS 4, that’s not entirely off the table. No, it’s more... fundamental.

We had that colloquium this afternoon with Dr. Anya Sharma from Kavli on quantum entanglement. Mind-bending stuff. The idea that particles, separated by light-years, can instantaneously influence each other, blurring the lines of causality and locality. It makes you wonder what "real" even means. And then, back in my room, wrestling with the Ma 2 problem set on abstract algebra – proving the *existence* of an identity element in some obscure group, or showing a unique solution *exists* under specific conditions.

It’s like every class here, every equation, every line of code, is constantly poking at the edges of what we perceive, what we know, what *is*. Does an electron truly *exist* in a definite state before we measure it? Or does its existence only coalesce in that moment of observation? And if so, what about me? Am I just a superposition of 'tired freshman' and 'aspiring physicist' until I actually *do* something concrete?

It makes you feel incredibly small, staring at these concepts. My little existence, here in a tiny dorm room in Fleming, trying to wrap my head around the universe's biggest questions, and also trying to figure out why my code for CS 1 keeps seg-faulting. Does my code even truly *exist* until it compiles without errors? (Okay, that's probably just sleep deprivation talking.)

But then, that's the thing, isn't it? To be here, at Caltech, means to grapple with these concepts. To be one of the tiny handful of people who get to spend their days trying to understand the fundamental fabric of... everything. Our existence here isn't just about grades or degrees; it's about being a part of this endless, terrifying, beautiful quest for knowledge. To ask the questions, even if the answers make your head spin.

Right now, my immediate existence hinges on finding enough energy to make it to the dining hall for dinner, and then maybe, just maybe, getting a few hours of sleep before Saturday morning's study session. The universe can wait a few hours while I reboot my own operating system.
