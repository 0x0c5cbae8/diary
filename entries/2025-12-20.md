Dear diary,

2025-12-20

Saturday. Finally. My brain feels like it’s been put through a centrifuge this past week. Finals are officially *over*, and I'm not sure if I should collapse into bed for a week straight or start pre-reading for Winter term to get ahead for five minutes. (Spoiler: I'll probably do neither and just stare blankly at my ceiling for a few hours.)

Today, though, my mind keeps circling back to CHEM 1a. Specifically, that nightmare of a problem set about the Haber process. All that high pressure, high temperature, trying to force those stubbornly inert *nitrogen* molecules to react with hydrogen. Professor Lee went on and on about the thermodynamics, the kinetics, the sheer industrial effort involved in just getting dinitrogen to *do something*.

It honestly felt like a metaphor for my entire freshman year so far. Like my brain is that unreactive N₂ molecule, floating around, perfectly content to do nothing, and Caltech is the Haber-Bosch reactor, cranking up the pressure, the temperature, adding catalysts in the form of TAs and caffeine, just trying to force some fundamental understanding into my skull. And sometimes, after all that effort, you only get a tiny yield, and you’re left wondering if it was even worth it.

But then, you think about how essential it is – for fertilizers, for life itself, for all those complex organic molecules we're going to dive into next term. All that energy just to convert something so abundant and unreactive into something so vital. It’s both incredibly frustrating and deeply, annoyingly, fascinating. I mean, we breathe it in all the time, about 80% of the air, doing nothing until it's "fixed" into something useful. Kind of like me this morning before my third coffee. Just existing.

Anyway, I’m going to try and fix myself to a horizontal position now. Maybe I’ll dream of ammonia. Or just sleep. Definitely sleep.
