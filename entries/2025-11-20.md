Dear diary,

Another Thursday, another existential crisis courtesy of Physics 1b. Or maybe it was just the sheer *volume* of information crammed into that one lecture in Beckman Auditorium this afternoon. Seriously, I walked out feeling like my brain had been through a high-speed data download, and half the files were corrupted.

Sitting there, in one of those surprisingly uncomfortable seats, watching Dr. Evans fill whiteboard after whiteboard with tensor equations that felt like they were written in ancient Greek, I swear I could feel my brain cells spontaneously combusting. The sheer scale of the *auditorium*, with all those rows of students intently absorbing (or pretending to absorb) every word, just amplifies the feeling of inadequacy. Everyone else seems to be furiously scribbling, nodding, looking like they're totally getting it. Meanwhile, I'm trying to decipher my own chicken scratch from three slides ago while Dr. Evans is already five ahead.

It’s not just the complexity, it’s the pace. Every week feels like drinking from a firehose, and this week the firehose is aimed directly at my face, full blast, right there in the *auditorium*. Mid-November. Which means only one thing: finals are looming. And every time I think I've got a handle on the p-sets, another concept gets thrown at us that just… shatters my confidence. Imposter syndrome is a constant roommate here.

Just finished a P-set for CS 1. It involved a dynamic programming problem that made me want to throw my laptop out the window of Page House. Thank goodness for the TA sessions, even if I still feel like I’m barely keeping my head above water. Now I'm back in my room, staring at a wall covered in scribbled formulas and a growing pile of coffee cups. Need to reread the lecture notes from the *auditorium* lecture at least three times before I even think about starting the next Physics P-set. And then there's the Chem lab write-up.

This is Caltech. This is freshman year. Send help (and maybe more coffee).
