Dear diary,

Another Monday. Woke up feeling like I’d slept on a bed of old PSets and espresso shots. Physics 1a was brutal today. Professor Schmidt was writing equations on the board at light speed, and with these old spectacles of mine, it was like trying to read ancient hieroglyphs through a perpetual fog. Seriously, I must have smudged them a dozen times, but it didn't help. I think my prescription is totally off.

Later, in chem lab, trying to distinguish between precipitates was an absolute nightmare. "Is that cloudy white or merely slightly less transparent?" I muttered to poor Sarah, who just gave me a bewildered look through her perfectly clear lenses. I swear, the only thing clear to me today was that I desperately need new glasses.

It’s funny, though. Not being able to see clearly made me think about how much of Caltech is a "spectacle" in itself. Not just the physical kind, like the epic prank last week where someone managed to put a giant inflatable rubber duck on the Millikan roof – that was a truly impressive *spectacle* of engineering and sheer audacity. But also, the intellectual spectacle. The way Professor Chang in Math 1a can derive complex theorems on the fly, making it look effortless. Or the sheer mental gymnastics my housemates do to solve a particularly gnarly PSets problem.

Sometimes I feel like I'm viewing all this through smudged, outdated lenses – struggling to keep up, to grasp everything, to find my place. I called the optometrist today. Appointment on Wednesday. Maybe with new spectacles, both literal and metaphorical, I'll start seeing things more clearly. Maybe the equations won't blur into an indecipherable mess, and maybe I'll stop squinting at the world and actually see the vibrant, crazy, brilliant place I'm in. Or, you know, just pass Physics 1a. One step at a time.
