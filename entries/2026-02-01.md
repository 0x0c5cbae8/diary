Dear diary,

Another Sunday, another battle. It feels less like a day of rest and more like a pre-Monday panic attack, meticulously disguised as "catching up." My brain feels like it’s been put through a centrifuge this week. Between the PHYS 1b P-set that required me to calculate the thermodynamic properties of *imaginary* gases and the intro to Abstract Algebra problem that I swear was written in ancient hieroglyphs, I’m surprised I still remember my own name.

But the real kicker today, the thing that’s been gnawing at my grey matter, is this infernal CS 2 P-set. It’s got a problem about a rabbit population model. Not just any rabbit population, mind you, but one with incredibly specific, almost cruel, breeding parameters. You know, the classic "a pair of rabbits are put into a field, how many pairs will there be after X months" type of thing, but with a twist that makes the Fibonacci sequence look like child's play. I swear, the professor just sits there devising ways to make us lose sleep.

I spent *hours* trying to optimize the recursive solution, then the iterative one, then wondering if there was some elegant matrix exponentiation trick I was missing. It was a complete rabbit hole. I started with Stack Overflow, moved onto obscure academic papers from the '70s about discrete population dynamics, then somehow ended up on a Wikipedia page about the conservation efforts for the Amami rabbit in Japan. My initial goal was to understand an `O(log n)` solution; my current state is contemplating the evolutionary pressures on *Pentalagus furnessi*. This is why I can’t have nice things, or rather, why I can't finish P-sets efficiently. One small question, one innocent-looking `rabbit.py` file, and suddenly I’m an expert in lagomorph biology and simultaneously two hours behind schedule for my Chem 1a reading.

It’s 1 AM, and the rabbits in my code are still stubbornly refusing to propagate correctly. Or perhaps they're propagating *too* correctly, and my understanding of "correct" is what's fundamentally flawed. I even briefly considered just drawing a picture of a cute rabbit and writing "I give up" on the P-set, but then I remembered this is Caltech, and that would probably earn me negative points for lack of intellectual fortitude.

I need sleep. Maybe tomorrow the solution will magically appear. Or maybe I’ll dream of giant, multiplying rabbits chasing me across the Olive Walk. At least then the P-set would have some tangible, terrifying payoff.
