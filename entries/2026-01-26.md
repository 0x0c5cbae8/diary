Dear diary,

Monday. January 26, 2026. Another one for the books, or more accurately, for the endless stack of p-sets. My brain feels like it's been put through a centrifuge today, separating out all the useful bits and leaving just a residue of caffeine and existential dread.

Ph 1b was a blur of electromagnetic fields this morning – honestly, I'm pretty sure Professor Bova speaks in Maxwell's equations. Then it was straight to the computer lab for CS 1a, trying to debug a recursive function that absolutely refused to cooperate. I swear, sometimes the code just *knows* you're under a deadline.

But the real challenge, the *beast* of my day, was the Ma 1b p-set. I’d been putting it off, dreading the geometric series and Taylor expansions that look deceptively simple on paper but unravel into multi-page proofs. I knew I couldn't tackle it in my dorm room; the chatter from Page House was just too distracting, even with noise-canceling headphones.

So, after grabbing a quick (and probably nutritionally deficient) dinner from the Browne, I embarked on my quest for the perfect academic hiding spot. I ended up in one of the tiny, almost claustrophobic carrels on the ground floor of Millikan. It's tucked away behind a stack of ancient physics journals, practically a forgotten alcove. It felt like I was deliberately digging myself into a little nook, a personal *burrow* where the outside world couldn't reach me.

And that’s exactly what I did for the next five hours. I genuinely felt like a little critter, *burrowing* deeper and deeper into the logic of the problems, scratching out calculations on scratch paper until my fingers ached. My world shrank to the glow of my laptop screen, the faint hum of the server racks somewhere in the building, and the frantic scribbling of my pencil. The silence was absolute, broken only by the occasional rustle of a page or the quiet sigh of another late-night studier in their own self-imposed *burrow*.

It's a strange kind of peace, this focused isolation. You get so lost in the work, so completely enveloped by the challenge, that everything else just fades away. I emerged from my little *burrow* around midnight, blinking in the harsher fluorescent lights of the library hallway, feeling a mix of exhaustion and triumph. One p-set down, three more to go before the end of the week. Time to crawl back to my actual bed now. Maybe I’ll dream of gophers and their mathematically elegant tunnel systems.
