Dear diary,

Another Saturday, another stack of P-sets. I swear, the weekends here are just weekdays in disguise, only with slightly more acceptable pajamas in the common room. I’ve been wrestling with the final problem on the Quantum Mechanics P-set all afternoon – something about scattering cross-sections for a potential well, and my brain feels like it’s trying to chew through titanium. My caffeine levels are dangerously low, and the whiteboard in my room is a chaotic mess of half-erased equations.

I finally gave up for a bit and trudged down to the dining hall. You know the drill: pizza, some vaguely Asian stir-fry, and... *broccoli*. Oh, the eternal dining hall broccoli. Steamed to within an inch of its life, pale green, and utterly devoid of flavor. It’s the kind of food that makes you wonder if "nutritious" is just a cruel joke played on overworked students. My friend Maya just sighed, loaded her plate with tater tots, and muttered something about "nutritional thermodynamics."

But then, as I speared a floret onto my plate, my Caltech brain, apparently unable to switch off, started making connections. I mean, look at it. The fractal-like structure, each tiny tree branching off into smaller ones, echoing patterns you see in chaos theory, in recursive algorithms, even in the branching of dendrites in a neural network. It's a perfect example of self-similarity, a natural iteration on display right there on my plate. Then I started thinking about the chemical composition – sulforaphane, glucosinolates – molecules with complex structures, interacting with biological systems, just like the quantum particles I was trying to describe. What's the quantum state of a sulforaphane molecule, anyway? Probably a superposition of deliciousness and blandness in this particular preparation.

Suddenly, the bland broccoli became a mini-research topic. Is there an optimal steaming time for maximum sulforaphane retention and *palatability*? What's the energy required to break the covalent bonds during chewing? My mind was off, spiraling into a tangent that had absolutely nothing to do with the P-set, but everything to do with how my brain works now. Everything here becomes a problem to be analyzed, even the most mundane vegetable.

I ended up eating the whole thing, half out of a vague sense of duty to my health, half because I was so lost in my broccoli-fueled scientific reverie that I forgot to stop. Maybe it’s a good brain food, after all. Or maybe my brain is just so starved for anything other than wave functions that it latches onto the nearest available data point.

Anyway, tangent over. Back to the scattering cross-sections. Wish me luck. I might need to derive the *broccoli-effect* on mental clarity to finish this.
