Dear diary,

December 12th, 2025. Friday. And what a Friday it's shaping up to be. Just barely submitted my CS 1 P-set a few minutes ago – my brain feels like it’s been put through a particle accelerator and then some. But the real torment, the *true* challenge that has consumed my week, has been Ph 1a's P-set 8. Specifically, the problem about the precessing **top**.

I swear, I must have watched a dozen videos of gyroscopes and spinning tops on YouTube, just trying to *visualize* the damn angular momentum, the torque, the nutation. I even dug out that cheap plastic spinning top I got in a cracker jack box when I was seven, just to hold it and watch it wobble. It looks so simple, a child’s toy, but the physics behind its graceful, albeit dying, spin? Absolute chaos in vector calculus form. Equations for days. I actually tried to derive Lagrange's equations of motion for it and almost had a meltdown. Dr. Davies would probably tell me to 'think more fundamentally,' but fundamental *feels* like the **top** of Mount Everest right now.

Everyone here is so ridiculously brilliant. I hear whispers about people finishing P-sets in half the time it takes me, getting perfect scores, already contributing to research labs as freshmen. It’s hard not to constantly feel like I'm barely clinging on, let alone aiming for the **top** of the class. Sometimes I just want to understand the material, truly understand it, even if it means sacrificing a few percentage points. But then the competitive spirit kicks in, the constant reminder that I'm at Caltech, a **top**-tier institution, and there's an expectation.

Right now, though, all I want to do is get some sleep. Maybe then my own brain will stop spinning like that damned top. Or maybe I'll dream of a world where *all* objects are spherical cows in a vacuum. A freshman can dream, right?
