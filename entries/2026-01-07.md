Dear diary,

January 7th, 2026. Wednesday. It's almost 2 AM and I *should* be asleep, but the high from finally cracking that Physics 1b problem set is keeping me wired. Today felt like a marathon, and the finish line was entirely a team effort.

Started the day feeling good, thinking I’d knock out the last few E&M problems for Dr. Feynman’s class after lunch. Big mistake. Huge. Problem 4, about the magnetic field of a current sheet *not* in free space, just chewed me up and spit me out. I tried every permutation of Ampere’s Law, Gauss’s Law for magnetism, even attempted some vector calculus I barely understand yet. Spent two solid hours banging my head against the wall in my room, fueled by lukewarm coffee and growing despair. My whiteboard looked like a crime scene of failed equations.

That's when I remembered what the upperclassmen always say: "Don't suffer alone, collaborate." So, I messaged Sarah and Ben, who I usually work with on p-sets. Sarah was already stuck on the same problem, and Ben, bless his soul, was just starting it but seemed to have a fresh perspective. We decided to meet in the Blacker dining hall, figuring a change of scenery might help, and maybe some late-night vending machine snacks.

It was amazing to watch it unfold. At first, we just laid out our individual attempts – where we got stuck, what assumptions we made. Sarah had a really clever way of setting up the coordinate system that I hadn't considered. Ben, who's strangely calm even when faced with insurmountable physics, had an insight about the boundary conditions that neither of us had properly accounted for. My contribution was probably just being the designated *explainer* – trying to verbalize our steps, which often helped us spot our own logical gaps.

We went back and forth, arguing good-naturedly, sketching out field lines, cancelling terms, and restarting from scratch more times than I can count. There were moments of frustration, sure. "No, Trevor, the *curl* of B isn't zero there!" or "Are you *sure* about the direction of the current?" But then, there were these incredible mini-breakthroughs. Someone would connect a seemingly unrelated concept, or draw a diagram that made everything click into place for the others.

By 1:30 AM, huddled around a table cluttered with empty snack wrappers and scribbled-on papers, we had it. The final solution. It wasn't just *my* solution or *Sarah's* or *Ben's*. It was *ours*. The satisfaction was so much deeper than if I'd solved it alone. We didn't just get the answer; we understood it from multiple angles, having dissected it and rebuilt it together. I learned so much more in those few hours of intense collaboration than I would have in twice the time working by myself.

It really hit me today how crucial collaboration is here at Caltech. It’s not just about getting the right answer; it’s about learning how to think differently, how to communicate complex ideas, and how to leverage each other's strengths. It turns an impossible task into a shared challenge, and frankly, makes the whole grueling experience a lot more bearable and even, dare I say, fun. Now, if only I could collaborate on getting some sleep before my 8 AM lab...
