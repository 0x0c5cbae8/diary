Dear diary,

It’s Wednesday, December 10th, and I officially feel like my brain has been put through a hydraulic press. I’m pretty sure the only thing keeping me upright is a steady drip of lukewarm coffee and the sheer terror of my upcoming QM final. Seriously, I just spent three hours trying to understand a single operator and ended up more confused than when I started. My roommate, Ben, is asleep face-down on his thermo textbook, and honestly, I'm jealous of his ability to just *pass out*.

The pressure this week is immense. Every lecture, every problem set, every late-night review session from the past ten weeks feels like it's piled on top of me. I literally feel *squashed* by the sheer volume of information I'm supposed to retain. It's like my skull is a tiny container, and the Caltech curriculum is an ever-expanding gas trying to burst out. I keep having this recurring nightmare where I'm trying to derive something on a whiteboard, and the chalk just crumbles into dust in my hand.

In a desperate attempt at self-care (and to avoid another packet of instant ramen), I actually ventured to the grocery store yesterday. My brilliant plan was to roast some butternut squash. It seemed healthy, autumnal, and somewhat sophisticated for a freshman. Key word: *seemed*. Getting that thing open was a whole ordeal. I swear, the peel was harder than some of the alloy samples from my MSE lab. I nearly lost a finger trying to stab it with a dull kitchen knife I borrowed from the communal lounge. Then, getting the seeds out was like performing surgery with oven mitts on. By the time it was finally cubed and drizzled with oil, I was so frustrated I almost just threw it in the trash. It ended up tasting fine, I guess – a little too mushy on one side, burnt on the other, but edible. But the whole process just added another layer of "why is everything so hard?" to my already overloaded brain. It's like even my attempt to relax and be healthy was designed to challenge my engineering skills.

I just need to make it through these last few days. I can see the winter break light at the end of the tunnel, promising a brief respite from equations and the constant feeling of inadequacy. Maybe then I can finally just *be* for a while, without feeling like I'm constantly on the verge of being squashed flat.
