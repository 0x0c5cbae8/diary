Dear diary,

Friday again. And I swear, the only thing more packed than my schedule this week was the density of unsolved problems on this latest Quantum Mechanics P-set. Seriously, Dr. Chen expects us to derive the uncertainty principle from first principles *and* make a gourmet meal in the same amount of time. My brain is officially fried.

Spent most of the afternoon holed up in the library, trying to untangle some particularly nasty integrals. It's funny how a good struggle can make you forget everything else for a bit, even the hunger pangs. But then the notifications started buzzing, reminding me of all the other things looming.

We had our first real Bio lab session yesterday for Bi 1. We were mostly identifying different cell types and structures, preparing slides. My lab partner, Maya, is really good at spotting things. She was looking at this slide of some *Giardia* sample – apparently a common intestinal parasite. Dr. Lee was walking around, checking on our progress, and he pointed out these specific, resistant forms of the parasite. He called them 'cysts.' They looked like these tiny, tough, almost perfectly oval capsules, designed to survive harsh conditions outside a host. He said they were dormant, but ready to spring back to life once they found a suitable environment.

It stuck with me. Maybe it’s just the sleep deprivation talking, but sometimes I feel like my own thoughts are little cysts. All these complex ideas, theories, derivations, they just encapsulate themselves in my brain, dormant. I learn them, absorb them, but then they just sit there, waiting for the right prompt, the right problem, to reactivate and actually *do* something useful. Right now, most of my knowledge feels like it’s in a 'cyst' state, just surviving the Caltech onslaught, waiting for the moment when it can truly be put to work.

Or maybe I’m just projecting my exhaustion onto parasitic survival mechanisms. Probably the latter. Either way, weekend P-sets await. At least I can make some progress on them without a looming class. Gotta go grab some late-night food from Chandler. Wish me luck for the next batch of encapsulated learning.
