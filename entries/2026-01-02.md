Dear diary,

It's Friday, January 2nd, and I'm officially back in my Fleming dorm room. Winter break felt like it flew by in a blur of last-minute studying, a quick trip home, and then boom—back to the grind. Classes don't officially start until Monday, but the pre-term anxiety is already setting in. My desk is buried under a fresh stack of textbooks and printouts for next term’s quantum physics (don't even ask) and a particularly intimidating-looking P-set for Analytical Mechanics I that Professor Thorne posted "just to get us thinking."

But what's really been occupying my brain today isn't quantum fields or Lagrangian mechanics, it's a piece of paper, or rather, an online form, labelled "Course Prerequisite Waiver Request." Specifically, for CS 1.

You'd think after coding competitively in high school and building a fairly complex drone navigation system last summer, I'd be able to breeze through Caltech's intro to programming with Python. My advisor, Dr. Albright, even suggested I consider submitting a **waiver** to skip it and jump straight into CS 2 or maybe even something more specialized like CS 11 (Data Structures). It would free up three precious units, potentially letting me take another elective or just… breathe.

The thought is tempting. My brain feels perpetually overloaded, and the idea of sitting through Python basics again feels like a waste of time I don’t have. But then I talk to the upperclassmen, and they all have that knowing look. "Caltech CS 1 isn't *just* Python, Trevor," one of them said. "It's about thinking like a Caltech engineer. Debugging with an almost pathological attention to detail. Learning the *right* way to structure your code, even for simple stuff."

So here I am, staring at the screen, with the deadline for submitting this darn **waiver** looming. Do I trust my past experience and try to accelerate, hoping I don't miss some fundamental "Caltech-approved" way of thinking that will haunt me in later courses? Or do I buckle down, take the "easy" class, and risk being bored out of my mind, just to make sure I don't have any gaps? It feels like another one of those freshman dilemmas, where every decision seems to have potentially catastrophic downstream effects.

I guess I'll spend the rest of this "break" Friday poring over the CS 1 syllabus again and maybe pinging Dr. Albright one last time. Wish me luck. I'm going to need it, regardless of whether I sign that waiver or not.
