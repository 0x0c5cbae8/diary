Dear diary,

Another Thursday down, and I swear my brain feels like it’s been put through a P-set wringer. Physics 1c is already starting to ramp up, and the differential equations for Chem 1b are just… something else. It feels like every neuron I possess is dedicated to solving problems or trying to remember which functional group is which. I’m pretty sure I dreamt in vectors last night.

By late afternoon, I just needed to get *out*. The campus bubble, as comforting as it often is, can also feel incredibly stifling when you're staring down three upcoming midterms. I shoved my laptop into my bag, grabbed my headphones, and made a spontaneous decision: I was going to ride the **subway**.

Yeah, I know. Not exactly a grand adventure, but just the thought of the Metro A Line pulling me away from the endless equations and the smell of the lab was appealing. I walked over to the Memorial Park station, the air feeling surprisingly crisp for February. Standing on the platform, watching the tracks stretch into the distance, was already a mini-escape.

The train wasn't too crowded. I found a seat by the window and just watched the world go by. It’s funny, you spend so much time here immersed in the incredibly specific, highly structured world of Caltech, and then you hop on a train, and suddenly you’re just one face among dozens of people going about their entirely different lives. There was a guy sketching in a notebook, a woman engrossed in a novel, a couple just quietly holding hands. No one was talking about quantum mechanics or the optimal path for a robot arm. It was… normal. And weirdly refreshing.

I didn't even have a specific destination in mind, just wanted the feeling of movement. I rode it past Downtown LA, catching glimpses of the skyline, the traffic, the endless sprawl. There’s something almost meditative about the rhythm of the train, the slight sway, the distant rumble. It’s a different kind of problem-solving, I guess – figuring out how all these different lives and paths intersect and diverge, all moving together for a while in the same metal tube.

I ended up getting off at Pershing Square, just for a few minutes, breathing in the city air, hearing the street performers, and then getting back on a train heading home. The return journey felt different; I felt a bit more grounded, a bit less trapped in my own head. The noise of the world outside the train felt less overwhelming, more like a hum.

Back on campus now, the hum of the air conditioning in my room seems louder, but the P-sets don't feel quite as monstrous. Maybe it's just the fresh air, or maybe it’s the reminder that there’s a vast, chaotic, beautiful world outside of problem sets and lectures, and sometimes you just need to ride the subway to remember it.

Time to tackle that Chem P-set now. Wish me luck.
