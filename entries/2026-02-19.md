Dear diary,

Ugh, another Thursday. Feels like the week just *starts* ramping up right about now, right when I’m already feeling the weight of the last three days of lectures and labs. Spent practically all day staring at this Ma 1a P-set, which is due tomorrow. Problem 7, specifically. It's about Fourier series, but the function they've given us for decomposition is… tricky. Discontinuities everywhere. Getting the coefficients themselves isn't too bad, it's the convergence criteria.

I’ve spent the last three hours trying to perform a rigorous *analysis* of the series' behavior at the points of discontinuity. My textbook says one thing, but then Professor Schmidt in office hours hinted at a more nuanced interpretation for this specific type of piecewise function. It’s not just about plugging values into the Dirichlet conditions; it’s about breaking down the function, *analyzing* its symmetry, anticipating how the infinite sum will "overshoot" or "undershoot" at the jumps. I swear, sometimes I feel like my brain is just one giant *analysis* engine, constantly processing, evaluating, critiquing.

I even find myself doing it outside of P-sets. Like earlier, at lunch in the dining hall, I was trying to *analyze* the optimal strategy for getting a good spot at a table during peak hours, factoring in tray return times and typical friend group sizes. Or trying to *analyze* why the coffee machine in my dorm sometimes dispenses lukewarm water instead of coffee (Is it a pressure issue? A heating element malfunction? A malicious prank by a senior?). This Caltech life is just one big, continuous exercise in *analysis*. My own performance, the efficiency of my study groups, the probability of actually getting enough sleep this week… It’s exhausting, but also kinda thrilling when something finally clicks after hours of rigorous *analysis*.

Still haven't fully nailed Problem 7, though. Guess it's time for another round of *analysis* before I call it a night and try to get a measly four hours of sleep. Maybe a fresh pair of eyes tomorrow morning, after I've had a chance to let my brain rest from all this intensive… well, you know.
