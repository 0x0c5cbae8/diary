Dear diary,

Another Sunday, another battle. It’s 11:30 PM, and I’m still wrestling with this CS 1 problem set on algorithms. My brain feels like it’s been put through a wringer, then microwaved. Only a few weeks left until finals, and the pressure is starting to feel... well, *sultan-like* in its oppressive weight.

That's a weird thought, isn't it? "Sultan-like." It popped into my head earlier when I was desperately trying to take a five-minute mental break. I ended up scrolling past some article about ancient empires, and there was this picture of a magnificent palace, all domes and intricate mosaics. I remember thinking, 'Imagine being a sultan. No problem sets. No deadlines. Just absolute power, probably a team of scholars doing all your calculations for you.'

Then I looked around my dorm room – cramped desk, overflowing recycling bin of instant ramen cups, a diagram scrawled on the whiteboard that still doesn't quite make sense. Not exactly a palace. And I'm definitely not commanding any scholars to derive the runtime complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm for me.

It's funny, though. In a way, Caltech feels like it's training us to be sultans of a different kind. Not of land or people, but of knowledge, of problem-solving. Every p-set conquered, every concept finally understood, feels like adding another jewel to some mental crown. It’s a dominion over equations, a kingdom of code. And our professors, they are the true sultans of their fields, each with their own vast empire of specialized expertise. Dr. Feynman (well, his ghost anyway) still rules over the physics department like a benevolent, quantum sultan.

Even this brutal CS problem, which currently feels like it’s demanding tribute in hours of my life, is just another challenge on the path to becoming one of those... knowledge sultans. I mean, it’s not exactly a stroll through an opulent garden, but the satisfaction of finally getting the recursion to work – that’s a pretty sweet victory.

Okay, enough philosophical meandering. That algorithm isn't going to debug itself. Back to my humble "throne" (aka, my swivel chair) and my command over this screen. One day, maybe I'll get a bigger desk. And less ramen. A boy can dream.
