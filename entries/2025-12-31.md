Dear diary,

2025-12-31 (Wednesday)

Can't believe it's already the last day of the year. This past term, my first at Caltech, feels like it lasted an eternity and flew by in a blur all at once. Finals were brutal. I'm pretty sure my brain chemistry was not what you'd call 'stable' for the last two weeks of classes, powered purely by coffee and the lingering scent of desperation in Millikan Library.

But now, being home for break, with no problem sets looming over my head, it's incredible how much clearer everything feels. It’s like the initial transient response of my system to the Caltech input has finally settled, and I'm starting to approach a *stable* state. Professor Davies in Phys 12 taught us about dynamic equilibrium, how systems always try to return to a balanced state after a perturbation. I feel like I've been a physical system constantly perturbed since September!

I'm actually starting to feel… stable. Not just in terms of grades – though I'm relieved I passed everything – but internally. The imposter syndrome hasn't vanished entirely, but it's not a constant scream in my head anymore; more of a polite murmur. I’ve found my rhythm for studying, figured out which coffee shop has the best late-night vibes, and even started to build a genuinely *stable* group of friends in my house. We had a great time celebrating Christmas on campus before heading home.

Looking back, I learned so much more than just physics equations and coding syntax. I learned how resilient I could be. How to ask for help (eventually). How to distinguish between an unstable solution and a robust, *stable* one, not just mathematically, but in managing my time and energy.

I’m actually excited for 2026. The spring term will be another challenge, I’m sure, but I feel like I have a more *stable* foundation now. Maybe I can even get more than five hours of sleep a night. A guy can dream, right?

Happy New Year, diary.
