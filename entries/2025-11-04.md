Dear diary,

Another Tuesday down, and my brain feels like it’s been run through a particularly aggressive centrifuge. Chem 1a problem set due tomorrow, Ma 1a proofs still haunting my dreams, and then there’s the EAS 10 project. That’s what’s really been chewing at my mental RAM today.

We’re supposed to design a compact, multi-functional storage unit for a dorm room – think maximizing space in an absurdly tiny footprint. I've been wrestling with a sliding panel concept for the main access point, but everything felt clunky. Hinged doors are out (too much swing space), traditional drawers are too deep for the specific application. I spent a good hour in the mechanical engineering shop, staring at various sliders and pivots, feeling like I was missing something obvious.

Then, during a late-night study break (which mostly involved me wandering the halls looking for coffee), I passed by one of the old lab offices in Dabney. Someone had left the door ajar, and inside was this ancient, beautiful wooden cabinet. Not quite a roll-top desk, but similar in its closure mechanism. It had a flexible, slatted cover that slid smoothly into a hidden groove. And it hit me: a **tambour** door!

It’s such an elegant solution. The individual slats, connected by a backing, allowing the whole thing to bend and disappear, either into the cabinet itself or along a curved path. No swing, no pull-out space needed, just a clean, compact opening. It's almost deceptively simple, but the engineering required to make it durable and smooth – the tolerances, the material choices, the track design – it's fascinating.

I immediately started sketching out ideas for my project. The idea is to integrate a small, hidden compartment that can only be accessed by this kind of rolling mechanism. It solves the space problem beautifully. I spent the next two hours researching different tambour designs, from wooden slats to flexible plastic membranes. Who knew a furniture detail could be so captivating? Caltech really does make you appreciate the genius in the mundane.

Now I just need to figure out the best way to model the curvature and ensure a jam-free glide. Probably going to pull an all-nighter with the CAD software. My coffee supply is already dwindling. But at least I have a direction, and a truly cool piece of engineering to obsess over for a bit.
