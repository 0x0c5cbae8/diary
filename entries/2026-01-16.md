Dear diary,

It’s finally Friday, January 16th, and I swear my brain feels like it's been wrung out and hung to dry on the Olive Walk. Another full week of Caltech, another stack of P-sets that would make a normal person weep, and another reminder that I am definitely not as smart as I thought I was in high school. But today… today had a different kind of intensity.

We had our Chem 1b lab this afternoon, and it was the organic synthesis module. Dr. Chen, who usually has a dry, almost monotone delivery, was particularly emphatic about **safety** today. She went through every single step of the procedure, not just for the reaction itself, but for handling the reagents, the proper ventilation, what to do if you spill something on yourself, how to use the eyewash station, the fire extinguisher locations… it felt like an hour-long lecture just on *not dying*.

I admit, I usually zone out a little during the initial safety brief – it's always the same, right? Goggles on, lab coat buttoned, no food or drink. But today, as I was carefully transferring a rather pungent solvent, my hand slipped *just a little*. The flask wobbled, and for a terrifying second, I imagined the whole thing splashing over my bare hand (because of course, my glove had ripped earlier and I hadn't replaced it yet, stupid Trevor). My heart actually hammered. I recovered it, no harm done, but that momentary jolt was enough to make me acutely aware of how fragile things are, and how many layers of **safety** protocols are actually there to protect us from ourselves.

It made me think about **safety** in a broader sense, too. Being a freshman at Caltech feels like constantly teetering on the edge of a very high cliff. Academically, I mean. Every P-set feels like a test of whether I truly belong here. There’s no real **safety** net for poor grades here, not like what I imagined college would be. The pressure is immense, and sometimes I feel like I'm just one bad grade away from completely unraveling.

But then, I also thought about the other kind of **safety** – the one I’ve found here. After the lab, I went straight to the dining hall, and my housemates, Sarah and Ben, were already there. I mentioned my near-miss with the solvent, and Sarah just laughed and told me about the time she almost set her hair on fire during Chem 1a. Ben, an upperclassman, offered to look over my Chem P-set tonight because he "remembers how brutal that one was." It's not a formal **safety** procedure, but it's a **safety** net of sorts. Knowing there are people who get it, who've been there, and who are willing to help, makes the whole tightrope walk feel a little less terrifying.

So yeah, today was about **safety**. Physical **safety** in the lab, and the quiet, reassuring **safety** of community in this utterly insane, brilliant place. Now, to tackle that MechE P-set before tomorrow's review session. Wish me luck.
