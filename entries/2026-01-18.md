Dear diary,

Another Sunday, another P-set-induced existential crisis. It’s 11 PM and I’m staring at a quantum mechanics problem that just refuses to yield. My brain feels like it’s been put through a computational blender, and honestly, right now, I’m questioning the *utility* of it all. Not just this specific problem, but this whole Caltech thing.

I mean, I get the long-term *utility* – the degree, the skills, the future job prospects, the ability to maybe, one day, understand the universe better than I do now (a low bar, admittedly). But in this moment, when I’m trying to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a region given its wave function, and I've been at it for three hours, the immediate *utility* feels… abstract, at best. My current utility function is screaming for sleep, or maybe just a bag of chips.

We were talking about classical mechanics and economic models of utility in our Intro to Econ class this week, and it's stuck with me. How do you maximize your *utility*? Is it pure satisfaction? And how do you quantify that? I'm trying to apply it to my own life. Is the *utility* derived from finishing this P-set before 1 AM higher than the *utility* derived from an extra hour of sleep, which would, in turn, increase my *utility* for tomorrow’s lectures? It's a never-ending optimization problem. My brain is basically running a continuous Monte Carlo simulation on my daily schedule, trying to find the highest total *utility* output, factoring in caffeine intake and emotional stability.

And then there's the *utility* of things that aren't P-sets. Like, is there a measurable *utility* in spending an hour playing ultimate frisbee with the guys, versus an hour grinding away at problem 3.7? Or in calling home to talk to my parents, which doesn’t directly advance my academic goals but definitely provides a different kind of positive *utility*? Caltech really forces you to weigh the costs and benefits of every single minute. It's not just about what you *can* do, but what maximizes your personal *utility* function across multiple, often conflicting, dimensions.

I guess the ultimate *utility* of this experience isn't just about the answers I write down on P-sets, but the framework it's giving me for thinking about the world, and even my own choices. It’s making me a better optimizer, a better decision-maker, even if it feels like I’m constantly operating at sub-optimal levels of sleep. Maybe that’s the real lesson: learning how to derive *utility* even from the struggle itself.

Okay, enough navel-gazing. Back to quantum weirdness. My internal *utility* meter just dinged, indicating that one more attempt at this problem has a higher expected value than trying to fall asleep right now with it unresolved. The life of a utility-maximizing freshman, I suppose.
