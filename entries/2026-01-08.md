Dear diary,

Another Thursday. Or rather, another day that feels like it’s been stretched thin across multiple timelines, all converging on the ever-present stack of P-sets. My brain feels less like a complex computational engine and more like a soggy, overcooked noodle, especially after today.

Today’s particular brand of intellectual torment came courtesy of Professor Schmidt in BE 150. We were diving deep into plant biology, and he spent a solid hour, an *entire* hour, just on *Zea mays*. Apparently, corn isn't just a simple staple food; it's a biochemical marvel, a genetic labyrinth of metabolic pathways, and, as of this afternoon, the bane of my existence.

The new P-set, due Monday, involves us designing a hypothetical genetic modification strategy to enhance drought resistance in corn. I swear, trying to map out the relevant gene sequences and protein interactions feels like I'm trapped in a corn maze, but instead of stalks, it's endless lines of code and obscure enzyme names. I spent the better part of three hours just getting the bioinformatics software to run without crashing, only to realize I’d accidentally tried to run a C++ compiler on a Python script. Rookie mistake, but one that cost me a good chunk of my precious P-set time.

By the time I finally decided to give my eyes a break from staring at microscopic diagrams of chloroplasts and starch granules, my head felt like it had been put through a corn mill. Ben, my roommate, just offered me a bag of stale tortilla chips, which, I have to say, felt less like a kind gesture and more like a cruel, corny joke. I almost threw a kernel at him. Almost.

I just want to understand how such a seemingly simple plant can contain so much complexity, and why it's chosen *me* to make its life hell this week. The house kitchen still smells faintly of burnt coffee and impending deadlines. Pretty standard for a Thursday night at Caltech. I guess I'll just keep telling myself that one day, all this intense molecular biology of *Zea mays* will somehow make me a better engineer. Or at least help me make better decisions when choosing my late-night snacks.

Time to dive back into the genomic data. Wish me luck.
