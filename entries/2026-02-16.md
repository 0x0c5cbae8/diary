Dear diary,

Monday. Already feels like a week since Sunday night, and it’s only 11 PM. Ph 1b (E&M) p-set 6 is absolutely brutal. I’ve been staring at this problem involving magnetic fields generated by a ridiculously shaped current loop for hours, and my brain feels like it's been put through a particle accelerator. Every complex equation I tried just led me deeper into a mathematical black hole. I was just about ready to throw my textbook out the window of North dorm.

Then, for some reason, Prof. Lee’s voice popped into my head from last week’s lecture, almost mocking: "Gentlemen, sometimes the most elegant solutions come from remembering the *basics*." And he wasn’t talking about quantum field theory, he was talking about… the very *definition* of current and magnetic force.

It felt almost humiliating, honestly. Here I am, a Caltech freshman, trying to wrestle with advanced vector calculus, and I had to go all the way back to the Biot-Savart Law and Ampere's Law, from scratch. Not just glancing at them, but truly re-deriving them in my head, remembering what each term *meant*. What magnetic field lines *are*. What current *is*. Just the absolute, fundamental *basics*. And wouldn’t you know it, a small, almost microscopic crack of understanding started to form. It’s still not fully solved, but at least I see *why* I was stuck. I was trying to run before I could properly walk, forgetting the foundational steps.

It's not just in physics, either. This whole Caltech experience, sometimes it makes you forget the most *basic* things about being a functional human. Like, has anyone seen my toothbrush in the last three days? Did I eat anything that wasn't reheated ramen or a vending machine granola bar today? And sleep? What's sleep? I'm pretty sure my brain needs *basic* oxygen and at least 6 hours of shut-eye to operate at peak capacity, not this frantic, hyper-caffeinated state it's been in since midterm season. I swear, sometimes just remembering to breathe deeply feels like an achievement here.

Tomorrow, I'm going to make a conscious effort. Finish this p-set by going back to the *basics* of vector fields. And then, I'm going to find my toothbrush, eat an actual vegetable, and try to get to bed before 2 AM. I need to get back to the *basics* of self-preservation if I want to make it through the term without turning into a sentient energy drink.

Wish me luck, diary.
