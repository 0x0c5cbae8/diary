Dear diary,

It’s officially Christmas Day. Thursday. And it's... quiet. So incredibly quiet. Most of my housemates packed up and left last week, off to warmer climes or just, you know, home. I opted to stay. Figured I could catch up on some reading (not *just* for classes, I swear!), enjoy the strangely empty campus, and maybe finally get around to organizing my desk. Turns out, "organizing my desk" mostly involves staring at it blankly for an hour.

The silence is almost unsettling after the constant hum of Caltech during term. No late-night study groups debating thermodynamics, no footsteps thudding down the hall, no frantic keyboard clacking from the room next door. Just the distant hum of the refrigerators and, occasionally, the whir of the heating system.

I felt a little wave of homesickness hit me this afternoon. Mom sent a picture of our tree, dad’s famous gingerbread cookies cooling on the counter. It looked so cozy and familiar. I almost called, but then I remembered the time difference, and also, I didn't want to sound like I was moping. I'm an independent Caltech freshman now!

So, instead, I found myself drawn down to the common room. And there it was, tucked away in the corner, looking a little dusty but entirely welcoming: the grand *piano*. I haven't really touched a proper keyboard since high school, when I grudgingly took lessons for what felt like an eternity. But something about today, the stillness, the need for a connection to something familiar and beautiful, just… pulled me in.

I sat down, hesitant at first, and my fingers felt clumsy on the keys. But then I started with something simple – "Silent Night." The notes felt a bit rusty, but they were there. It was a strange mix of rusty mechanics and muscle memory. After that, I tried a few more carols, and then some of the classical pieces I used to know. Chopin’s Nocturne in E-flat major was a mess, but I could hear echoes of it. It was like solving a different kind of problem set – one where the variables were rhythm and melody, and the solution was a feeling, not a grade. It reminded me that there's a different kind of logic, a different kind of beauty, beyond the equations and circuits that dominate my life here.

I spent a good hour down there, just letting the music wash over the empty common room. It felt like I was filling the silence with something meaningful, a little piece of home and a little piece of myself. Maybe I'll make this a regular thing, try to dust off some old skills, or even learn something new. After all, the quiet campus during break is the perfect time for a new project, even if it's just mastering a tricky new chord progression. My fingers are already a bit sore, but in a good way.

Now, time to see if the vending machine has any decent Christmas dinner substitutes. Probably just stale chips. Oh well.
