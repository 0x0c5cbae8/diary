Dear diary,

Saturday. Which, in Caltech parlance, mostly means "another day ending in Y to catch up on everything I didn't finish during the week." My desk is currently a battleground of coffee cups, crumpled scratch paper, and the dreaded Ph 1b lab report. Specifically, the "Discussion" section.

We ran that experiment on the thermal expansion of metals, and let me tell you, the results were… less than perfectly linear. There’s a distinct temptation, an almost primal urge, to *embellish* the data interpretation. To smooth out those bumps, to round up the R-squared value in my head, to make the conclusion sound more definitive than what the raw numbers really tell me. Just a little tweak, a clever turn of phrase to imply a precision that wasn't quite there.

Our TA, Sarah, gave a whole lecture last week about scientific integrity. She basically said, "If you embellish, you lie. If you lie, you might as well pack your bags for Harvey Mudd." Okay, maybe not that dramatic, but her point about presenting the *truth* of the experiment, even if it's messy, rather than an idealized version, really stuck with me. It’s hard, though. My brain, trained to solve problems elegantly, struggles with the awkward reality of experimental error. I want it to *look* perfect, to be a clean narrative. But science isn't always about clean narratives; sometimes it's about the ugly, beautiful truth of imperfection.

Later, after finally wrestling that discussion section into a state of unvarnished honesty (even if it felt a bit lackluster), I headed down to Avery for some dinner. Overheard a few upperclassmen at the next table swapping stories about their SURF projects from last summer. One guy, Liam, was recounting an anecdote about a near-catastrophic coding error that almost wiped a whole database. His description of the moment of panic, the sparks literally flying from his keyboard (I’m pretty sure that’s a slight *embellishment* given it was a software bug), and his heroic, all-night debug session was pure theater. Everyone was captivated, laughing, hanging on his every word.

And it hit me. In Liam's story, the embellishment wasn't a lie that undermined the core truth (he clearly *did* fix a major bug); it was an artistic choice. It made the story more engaging, more human, more memorable. It transformed a dry technical challenge into an epic saga. It added flavor and personality.

It's such a strange contrast, isn't it? In my lab report, embellishment is the enemy, something to be ruthlessly purged for the sake of objective truth. It muddies the waters, distorts reality. But in a social setting, or even in art, it's often celebrated. It enhances, it connects, it entertains. Sometimes it even clarifies by drawing attention to the *spirit* of an event rather than just the cold facts.

I guess the trick is knowing when to wield the embellishment brush, and when to put it down and just show the raw data. At Caltech, it seems like I'm constantly learning the appropriate context for everything. Another weekend, another philosophical crisis brought on by a lab report and a plate of mediocre pasta.

Time to stare at some P-chem notes. No embellishments there, just pure, unadulterated quantum weirdness.
