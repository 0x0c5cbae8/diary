Dear diary,

It’s Sunday again, January 25th, 2026, and I feel like I've just emerged from a four-day, caffeine-fueled fight with electrodynamics. My brain is a static-filled mess. I spent the better part of the afternoon trying to wrap my head around a particularly nasty Ph 12 problem set, and honestly, it felt like my cognitive abilities were in a rapid *decline*.

I remember in high school, and even last term with QCI, there was a certain thrill to tackling complex problems. A feeling of sharpening my mind against a difficult concept. Now? It feels less like sharpening and more like dulling. I stared at one integral for over an hour, convinced I was missing some fundamental trick, only to realize I was just too tired to properly follow the chain rule. It’s not just the immediate confusion; it’s this creeping sensation that my overall intellectual sharpness, my ability to quickly grasp and synthesize new information, is on a noticeable *decline*.

Is it the lack of sleep? I swear, I’ve averaged four hours a night this week. My energy levels are certainly in *decline*, and I find myself needing multiple trips to the coffee machine before noon. My physical health isn't doing much better; I can practically feel my immune system making a polite exit. I haven't seen the inside of Braun in weeks, and my diet mostly consists of instant ramen and whatever stale pastries are left in the dining hall. It's a recipe for a general all-around *decline*, I suppose.

The worst part is the self-doubt. Was I just good at high school because the competition wasn't as fierce? Am I witnessing the inevitable *decline* of my academic standing, where I was once at the top, and now I’m just... here? Everyone talks about imposter syndrome, but this feels more tangible. It feels like my raw processing power is simply not what it used to be.

I tried talking to my roommate, Ben, about it, and he just nodded, bleary-eyed, saying, "Yeah, man. Sometimes I feel like I'm watching my GPA *decline* in real-time." So at least I'm not alone in feeling this way. Maybe it’s just the Caltech grind. Maybe we all hit this wall where the sheer volume and difficulty of material force a temporary, or even permanent, reassessment of our intellectual limits.

I guess I just have to push through, try to catch up on sleep tonight, and hope that this feeling of *decline* is temporary. I need to reverse this trend before I completely lose my mind.
