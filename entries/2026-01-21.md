Dear diary,

2026-01-21, Wednesday. Another Wednesday down, and honestly, my brain feels like it’s been put through a centrifuge. Mostly thanks to PHYS 1b lab. We’re working on the magnetic fields from current loops, and the entire afternoon was a masterclass in the absolute, non-negotiable criticality of **location**.

Every single Hall probe, every single wire, every tiny coordinate point had to be meticulously placed. If the probe was off by even half a millimeter from its intended **location** in the grid, our data set became about as useful as a chocolate teapot. Professor Ramirez kept circling, scrutinizing our setup like a hawk, repeating "Precision, gentlemen, precision!" until it felt like a mantra. I swear, I’m going to start measuring the exact **location** of my toothbrush every morning.

It got me thinking though, about how much of my life here at Caltech revolves around **location**. Like, finding the optimal **location** in Millikan library where I can actually focus without someone’s laptop fan sounding like a jet engine. Or the surprisingly difficult task of remembering the *exact* building and room number for an office hour that’s not in my usual circuit – sometimes it feels like they intentionally hide them. Even my dinner choices are often dictated by the proximity – or rather, the efficient **location** – of the food truck that still has short lines. And don't even get me started on calculating the best **location** to sit in lecture for optimal whiteboard viewing while still being able to duck out quickly for the next class across campus.

And then there’s the bigger picture of **location**. Where am I, Trevor, in my first year here? Am I on the right track, heading to the right 'intellectual location' for what I want to do? Am I finding my place, my social **location**, among all these brilliant minds? Sometimes it feels like I'm a lone electron, just trying to find its stable orbit in the vast atomic structure that is Caltech. I think I'm getting there, slowly but surely. Just need to calibrate my internal GPS more accurately.

Anyway, my own **location** is currently my bed, and it’s calling my name louder than Professor Ramirez’s precision lectures. Need to recharge for tomorrow's problem set. Hope I can find the right **location** for my brain cells to tackle it.
