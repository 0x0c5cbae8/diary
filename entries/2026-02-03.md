Dear diary,

Ugh, Tuesday. My brain cells are definitely protesting this week. Spent most of the evening wrestling with the P-Chem p-set, which involved some truly heinous calculations about molecular interactions, and then shifted gears to the CS 1 p-set – which, of course, decided to throw in a curveball about data clustering.

We had this problem where we needed to group a bunch of data points based on their features. The core of it, naturally, was defining "similarity." How do you quantify that two data points are alike? Is it Euclidean distance? Cosine similarity? Jaccard index? I spent a solid hour just agonizing over the choice of metric, because a slightly different definition of "similarity" could completely change the clusters, and thus the insights you draw from the data. It's fascinating how such an abstract concept can have such concrete, tangible consequences. Like, if you're building a recommendation engine, choosing the wrong similarity metric could mean recommending socks to someone who just bought a surfboard. Precision matters. A lot.

It got me thinking, though, beyond the algorithms and the datasets. I took a quick break, wandered down to the vending machine for a pathetic attempt at a healthy snack (failed, ended up with gummy bears), and saw a few other freshmen from my house, all hunched over their own laptops, looking equally glazed over. Some were battling linear algebra, others debugging circuits for E&M, one guy was just staring intensely at a blank piece of paper, probably conjuring a proof out of thin air.

We're all so different here, aren't we? From all over the world, with unique quirks and obsessions. But there's this profound *similarity* too. This shared, slightly masochistic dedication to figuring things out. This collective groan when Professor Davies drops another impossible p-set. This quiet determination to push through, even when it feels like your brain is melting. It’s comforting, in a strange way. Knowing that while my specific struggle with cosine similarity versus Euclidean distance might be unique to my CS problem, the *feeling* of the struggle, the late nights, the caffeine-fueled despair, is a similarity we all share. It makes Caltech feel a little less lonely, even at 1 AM.

Now, back to the P-Chem, where I'm pretty sure I just calculated the energy of an electron to be roughly equivalent to a small star. Probably a sign I need more sleep.
