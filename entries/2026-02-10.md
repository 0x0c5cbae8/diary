Dear diary,

2026-02-10. Tuesday. I’m writing this at… 1:47 AM. Another Tuesday bleeding into Wednesday. My desk lamp is the only source of light in my room, casting long shadows from the stacks of textbooks and half-empty coffee mugs. The air smells faintly of cold brew and despair. Okay, maybe just cold brew. But it definitely *feels* like despair.

I'm utterly, irrevocably *exhausted*. And not just the "I pulled an all-nighter" kind of exhausted, though that was certainly a factor for yesterday's Ma 1b PSet. This is a deeper, more insidious kind of exhaustion. It's the kind that settles into your bones, makes your brain feel like static, and convinces you that merely lifting your arm is a monumental effort.

Waking up this morning felt like prying myself out of quicksand. My alarm, a cheerful little jingle I used to love, now sounds like a siren of impending doom. Ph 1b lecture was a blur of electromagnetic fields and quantum mechanics. Professor Davies's voice was a low hum, the equations on the board swimming before my gritty eyes. I scribbled notes out of habit, but I doubt I retained a single new concept. It’s like my brain hit its processing limit hours ago and is now just running on fumes and the faint echo of past knowledge.

After lunch – which I barely tasted, just shoved down for fuel – I tried to make a dent in the new Cs 2 lab. Two hours later, I had maybe three lines of working code and a headache that felt like a vise tightening around my skull. Every error message felt like a personal insult, a confirmation of my depleted mental state. I just kept staring at the screen, the words blurring, the logic refusing to click into place. It’s infuriating. I know I *can* do this when I’m rested, but right now, I’m just staring at a wall.

House dinner was a cacophony I couldn't engage with. My housemates were debating the merits of various PSet collaboration strategies, and I just nodded vaguely, picking at my pasta. Social energy? Gone. Kaput. The thought of having to form coherent sentences and react appropriately was too much. I just wanted to retreat into silence.

Now, here I am. The Ma 1b PSet for next week is sitting open on my laptop. The problems look like ancient hieroglyphs. I read the first one three times, and honestly, I couldn't tell you what it's asking. My body aches from sitting, my eyes burn from screen time, and my mind is a desolate wasteland. It’s the sheer cumulative weight of it all – the constant intellectual demand, the relentless pace, the feeling of always being behind, the perpetual sleep debt – that has truly done me in.

I just want to lie down and not think about eigenvalues or algorithms or the next deadline. I want to sleep for a week. Or maybe just a solid 8 hours. Is that too much to ask? I don't even have the energy to feel dramatic about it anymore. Just... numb. I should probably try to get at least *some* sleep before my 8 AM tomorrow, but even the idea of closing my eyes feels like a heavy undertaking.
