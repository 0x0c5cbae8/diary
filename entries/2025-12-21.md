Dear diary,

I actually made it. I can't quite believe it, but I’m officially done with my first Caltech term. FINISHED. The last final, Math 1a, was yesterday morning, and my brain feels like it’s been put through a cosmic particle accelerator. Right now, it’s 6 PM on Sunday, and the silence in Avery is almost deafening. Most people packed up and fled this morning, probably already halfway home. I’m leaving tomorrow.

My last "meal" on campus this term was… well, let's just say it was less a meal and more a desperate rehydration effort. A hastily microwaved Cup Noodles at 3 AM while trying to debug a Python script that refused to cooperate for my CS final, followed by an equally desperate coffee run. Survival food, pure and simple. It fuels the grey matter, but it certainly doesn't nourish the soul. The dining hall has been pretty sparse too, with the skeleton crew staff giving us tired, sympathetic smiles.

But I've spent most of today in a blissful, semi-catatonic state, occasionally roused to shove clothes into a suitcase or pack up my notes (which I'll probably never look at again, but a freshman can dream, right?). And the whole time, my mind keeps drifting to one glorious, all-encompassing thought: tomorrow.

Tomorrow, I'm heading home. And the first thing I plan to do when I walk through the door is sit down for my mom’s legendary lasagna. It’s not just the taste, though that’s obviously a huge part of it. It’s the ritual. The warm kitchen, the smell of garlic and tomatoes, everyone gathered around the table, no frantic problem sets lurking in the background, no need to explain why *P=NP* is an unsolvable mystery (yet). It’s a *real* meal. A home-cooked, no-strings-attached, I-don't-have-to-think-about-it-at-all kind of meal. The kind that makes you feel human again after weeks of relying on caffeine and sheer willpower.

I didn't realize how much I missed that until now. It’s funny how something as simple as a proper meal can symbolize the end of one grueling chapter and the promise of a much-needed break. Forget the grades for a minute (okay, maybe not *forget*), I'm just looking forward to that first bite of lasagna. It’s going to taste like victory and comfort all rolled into one.

Winter break, here I come!
