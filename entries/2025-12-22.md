Dear diary,

Monday. And oh my god, the last Monday of my first ever Caltech term. It feels like just yesterday I was lugging boxes into Lloyd and trying to figure out how to navigate the washing machines without breaking anything. Today, though, feels... lighter. Finals are officially *done*. My brain still feels like it’s been put through a quantum entanglement simulator, but the immediate pressure is off.

I spent most of the day just trying to decompress, which mostly involved staring blankly at my wall for a bit, then packing. My train home is early tomorrow, and I actually can't wait to see my family. Mom's probably already got a list of chores for me, but I don't even care. Just the idea of sleeping in my own bed and not thinking about p-sets or problem sessions is heavenly.

The last thing I packed was the gift for Mom. It's a *planter*. Not just any planter, of course. I probably spent way too many hours on it, hours that should have probably gone towards refining that final physics report, but honestly, it was a much-needed mental break. I designed it with a small, passive wicking system from a reservoir I built into the base – inspired by some fluid dynamics concepts from Professor Smith's intro lecture. Plus, I managed to integrate a tiny moisture sensor with an e-ink display that shows the soil humidity percentage and a "refill water" alert. Had to scavenge some old components from the electronics lab's scrap bin for that part.

It started as a simple idea: Mom likes her herbs, and sometimes forgets to water them when she's busy. So, a self-watering *planter*. But then, you know, the Caltech curse kicked in, and I thought, "How can I optimize this? How can I add a data display?" Now it's probably the most over-engineered terracotta substitute in existence. Hope she doesn't think I'm making fun of her gardening skills, but I really just wanted to make something useful and, well, *smart*. It's oddly satisfying to see the little display light up, confirming my calculations.

It feels good to have made something practical, even if it's for a plant and not a fusion reactor. Maybe it's a metaphor for me this term – trying to establish roots, figure out the best way to absorb knowledge, and occasionally needing a 'refill water' alert myself when I've pulled too many all-nighters.

Anyway, off to try and get some actual sleep before the train. Winter break, here I come!
