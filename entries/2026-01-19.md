Dear diary,

Ugh, Mondays. This one felt particularly… *dense*. My brain feels like it’s been put through a quantum entanglement experiment, then promptly forgotten in a black hole. Had a rough Calc III lecture this morning – seriously, how many dimensions *are* there, really? – followed by a two-hour lab prep for CHE 1a that felt like trying to assemble a particle accelerator with a toothpick.

But then, something actually interesting happened in ME 11 (Introduction to Engineering Design). Professor Davies was doing a lightning round on biomimicry, and for a split second, a slide flashed up with a picture of a humpback whale's flipper. He barely spent thirty seconds on it, just mentioned how the leading-edge tubercles reduce drag and increase lift, making these enormous creatures surprisingly agile in the water.

It really stuck with me. Later, while trying (and failing) to debug some Python code for my CS 1 P-set, I kept thinking about it. A creature so utterly *massive*, weighing tens of thousands of pounds, yet engineered by evolution to move with such incredible hydrodynamic efficiency. The sheer scale is mind-boggling. How does a brain that huge even work? How do they navigate those vast oceans, communicate over hundreds of miles? It’s like nature built the ultimate submarine, and we’re still trying to figure out how to replicate one tiny design feature.

Sometimes Caltech feels like that – like an impossibly deep, vast ocean, and I'm just this tiny plankton trying to absorb enough knowledge to survive. The problems we tackle, the concepts we're expected to grasp… they feel whale-sized. And I'm just Trevor, trying not to get eaten by the next P-set deadline. My CS project certainly feels like a "whale" of a task right now, an intimidating mass of bugs and elusive logic.

Maybe I need to channel my inner whale and find some hidden efficiency within myself. Or at least figure out how to reduce the drag on my brain cells.

Still got that Phys 1b P-set to tackle before I can even *think* about sleep. Wish me luck.
