Dear diary,

December 4th, 2025 (Thursday)

Well, it's official. The final boss of Fall term is upon us. Ph 1c and Ma 1c finals are looming, and I swear my brain feels like a perpetually burning CPU, running at 150% capacity. I thought I'd figured out the rhythm of this place, but finals week (or rather, pre-finals week, since everything blends into one glorious, sleep-deprived blur here) has a way of reminding you just how much there is to learn and how little time you have to learn it.

Today's particular brand of fun involved finishing up the last problem on the dreaded Ch 1a take-home portion. I was so engrossed, head buried in textbooks and molecular models, that I completely lost track of time. When I finally surfaced, blinking in the harsh glow of my desk lamp, I realized I had exactly eight minutes to get from Lloyd House to the Avery office hours for a quick sanity check before submission. Eight minutes! That's practically a cross-country trek on this campus, especially when you've been sitting for six hours straight.

So, naturally, I launched myself out the door, sprinting across the Olive Walk, past Millikan, and up the stairs to Avery, my ancient, beloved (but clearly not running-appropriate) sneakers pounding the pavement. I made it, sweaty and slightly out of breath, just as the TA was about to pack up. Managed to get my question answered, submitted the problem set, and felt a wave of relief wash over me... until I got back to my room.

My right heel is now the proud owner of what I can only describe as a magnificent, throbbing *blister*. It's not just a little bubble; it's a topographical marvel, a testament to sheer velocity and questionable footwear choices. It hurts to walk, it hurts to stand, and I'm pretty sure it's developing its own tiny, independent pulse. I even tried to apply some of that fancy "second skin" stuff, but it just feels like I've gift-wrapped a small, angry volcano.

I guess it's just another Caltech souvenir, right? A physical manifestation of the academic sprint. My brain has metaphorical blisters from all the problem sets, so why shouldn't my feet? At least now I have a good excuse for hobbling around campus like a wounded duck.

Time to slather on some more ointment and dive back into Quantum Mechanics. Maybe a bit more carefully this time.
