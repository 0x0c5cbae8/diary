Dear diary,

Another Monday. Or, as I like to call it, "The day where the accumulated sleep debt of the weekend's P-sets comes crashing down." My alarm screaming "Good Morning" at 7:30 AM is truly a cruel joke. I swear the sun still thinks it’s Sunday. Or maybe it’s just the perpetual twilight of my dorm room.

Physics 1a was… physics. Dr. Chen managed to make quantum entanglement sound both mind-bendingly fascinating and utterly soul-crushing when he dropped the hint that "a basic understanding of the implications will be helpful for the upcoming exam." "Basic understanding" at Caltech means you could probably write a thesis on it. Then there was CompSci lab – debugging a particularly stubborn segmentation fault that felt less like coding and more like trying to perform brain surgery on a toaster with a spork.

But the real highlight of the day – and by "highlight" I mean "moment of profound intellectual dissonance" – came at dinner. Alex, who shares my frosh dorm and has a surprising penchant for scrolling through weird internet subcultures, piped up, "Hey Trevor, guess what? My horoscope said today was a day for 'unexpected insights and breakthroughs.'" He then proceeded to dramatically declare that the segfault in my code had, in fact, been my "unexpected insight."

I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm living in a parallel universe. I just spent three hours meticulously tracing memory allocations and pointer operations, and the solution involved fixing a simple off-by-one error. There was nothing "cosmically aligned" about it, Alex. It was just me, fueled by lukewarm coffee and existential dread, finding a bug.

But it got me thinking. **Astrology.** I mean, we're at Caltech. We're literally surrounded by the best astronomical instruments and minds on the planet. We've got JPL just down the road, sending probes to *actual* planets. And yet, there's this persistent belief that the configuration of those same distant celestial bodies, at the moment of your birth, somehow dictates your personality, your future, or whether you'll have "unexpected insights."

My brain, bless its logical little heart, immediately started doing the calculations. The gravitational influence of the attending doctor at my birth was almost certainly orders of magnitude greater than that of Mars. The light from many of those "constellations" took thousands of years to reach Earth, meaning the stars aren't even *there* anymore in the configuration we perceive. And don't even get me started on the precession of the equinoxes, which means the zodiac signs are off by a whole month from their supposed constellations. My "Virgo" sun sign would actually be a Leo if we were talking about *actual* star fields.

I tried to explain some of this to Alex, starting with "You know, the ecliptic has shifted by about 23.5 degrees due to axial precession since the Babylonians..." He just blinked and said, "Yeah, but it's *fun* to believe, isn't it?"

And you know what? Maybe it is. In a world of differential equations and quantum chromodynamics, perhaps there's a certain comfort in thinking the universe has a neat, predictable narrative just for you. Still, I think I'll stick to predicting my "breakthroughs" based on the amount of caffeine ingested and the number of debugging print statements added. Much more reliable, statistically speaking.

Now, if you'll excuse me, my P-set for Analytical Mechanics isn't going to solve itself, and I don't think Uranus is going to offer any helpful hints.
