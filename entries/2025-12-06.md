Dear diary,

Another Saturday, and true to Caltech form, it barely feels like a weekend. I woke up with the phantom weight of a p-set on my chest, specifically the one for CS 1. It’s got us dealing with data structures, and I swear I spent a solid two hours just trying to correctly implement a function that computes the **union** of two unordered linked lists without duplicates. My code kept merging them with a logic error, creating this weird, Frankenstein monster of a list that was neither here nor there. Debugging felt like trying to perform brain surgery on a spreadsheet – slow, meticulous, and probably damaging something vital.

After finally getting that beast to yield (mostly, I hope, pending grading), I dragged myself out for some actual food – not just instant ramen. Ended up at the Red Door, then found a spot in the student services building, surrounded by other equally frazzled-looking Techers. It made me think, actually. This whole place, this institution, it’s a massive, complex **union** of brilliant, eccentric, and often completely sleep-deprived individuals. We're all here, pursuing these insane academic goals, sometimes feeling completely alone in our struggles, but then you look around and realize everyone else is fighting their own p-set dragon, or trying to understand quantum mechanics, or debating the merits of a new programming language.

And then there's the House system. That's another kind of **union** entirely. Tonight, at House dinner, everyone was huddled together, complaining about the impending finals week, sharing horror stories about problem sets, but also just… being together. Laughing, even. It’s a strange comfort, knowing that even when you’re utterly overwhelmed, there's this collective, this *union* of shared experience that gets us through. It’s messy, sometimes frustrating, but it definitely feels like home. I guess even the most chaotic sets can form a coherent union eventually. Maybe my linked lists will too, with enough perseverance.

Now, back to the abstract algebra p-set. Wish me luck.
