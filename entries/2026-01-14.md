Dear diary,

Wednesday, January 14, 2026. Another one for the books, or more accurately, another one that’s tried to absorb me into its infinitely dense problem sets. It's almost 2 AM, and I’m pretty sure my blood has been replaced with cold brew. Ph 2b is really starting to show its teeth. We’re on waves and optics now, and I’ve been staring at problem 4.2 – a diffraction grating setup – for what feels like geological ages. The math isn’t even the hardest part, it’s visualizing the *physics* of it all, tying the Maxwell’s equations to the interference patterns, while my brain feels like it’s running on a 1990s dial-up connection.

My desk is a war zone of open textbooks, scratch paper filled with half-formed equations, and empty granola bar wrappers. I swear, sometimes I think the only thing keeping me upright is the sheer existential dread of a deadline. Just when I thought I was going to fuse with my monitor, my phone buzzed.

It was Mark. My step-brother.

"Yo, you alive? Mom says you haven't called in like a week. Also, did you see that new trailer for 'Galactic Warlords 7'? Looks sick."

I just stared at the text for a good minute, my mind still half-lost in the angular separation of diffraction orders. Mark. My step-brother, who probably hasn’t thought about a vector field since high school physics, if even then. He’s always been the chill one, into gaming and sketching, living a life that feels light-years away from the Caltech grind. Part of me wanted to send back a photo of my current problem set, just to illustrate how "alive" I am – specifically, how a significant portion of my brain cells are currently in a state of self-induced apoptosis.

But instead, I just typed back: "Alive. Trailer looks cool. Will call Mom tomorrow."

The sheer normalcy of his message was jarring. He’s probably just finished a casual evening of gaming, or maybe he’s out with friends, completely oblivious to the quantum mechanics of my sleep debt or the relativistic effects of time distortion when you’re cramming for a comps. It’s funny, we grew up in the same house, but sometimes I feel like we’re from different dimensions. He’s out there, enjoying the simple pleasures, and I’m in here, trying to model the universe from a 10x10 foot dorm room.

It actually helped clear my head a tiny bit. Just a brief, grounding moment of contact with the "outside world." Sometimes I forget there’s a whole life beyond problem sets and lectures, and that people exist who aren’t constantly trying to calculate the moment of inertia of a complex object. He’s probably just wondering if I’m still alive, or if I’ve been assimilated by the B-level Borg.

Okay, moment of reflection over. Back to the grating. Maybe a fresh pair of eyes (even if they're my incredibly tired ones) will see something new. Or maybe I just need another coffee. Definitely another coffee.
