Dear diary,

Happy New Year. If "happy" is the right word when you know winter term classes are looming like a category 5 hurricane on the radar. Spent most of today trying to actually *relax*, which for my brain apparently means running simulations of next term's workload and optimizing my future sleep debt. My parents called to wish me well, and I had to pretend I wasn't already mentally calculating the energy required to get through Quantum Mechanics.

Decided to tackle at least one New Year's resolution: stop being a total sloth. My body is starting to feel like a permanent fixture of my desk chair. So, I finally unboxed that ridiculous-looking athletic gear I ordered online a few days ago. My first proper pair of running *tights*. Seriously, who decided these things were a good idea? They feel like a second skin, but in a way that makes me wonder if I'm accidentally cross-dressing for an advanced biomaterial experiment.

But, you know, my Caltech brain immediately kicked in. I started looking at the stitching patterns – clearly designed to minimize chafing, probably some finite element analysis involved there. The fabric itself is fascinating: a blend of polyester and spandex, with microfibers probably engineered for optimal moisture-wicking and thermal regulation. I bet there’s a whole Ph.D. thesis on the compressive forces and their effect on blood lactate levels. I even googled "viscoelastic properties of compression sportswear" and found a few interesting papers. The tensile strength alone must be impressive to withstand the rigors of my eventual (and likely painful) runs around campus.

I'm going to try them out tomorrow morning, assuming I can drag myself out of bed before sunrise. If they help me shave even a millisecond off my pathetic mile time, or just make me feel slightly less like a blob of Jell-O, I'll consider it a win. Otherwise, it's just another data point in the "Trevor attempts fitness" experiment, and maybe a future design critique for a materials science project. Wish me luck. I have a feeling I'll need it.
