Dear diary,

November 26th, 2025. Wednesday. The last day before Thanksgiving break, and honestly, my brain feels like it’s been through a particle accelerator. Ma 1c P-set 8 finally submitted about an hour ago, but not without a valiant fight that left me feeling utterly *crushed*. My roommate, Liam, has already bailed for LAX, probably halfway home by now, eager for real food and parental sanity checks. Me? Still here, contemplating whether to brave the holiday travel chaos or embrace the blissful silence of a near-empty campus for a few days. Decided on the latter – more P-sets for Winter term, alas, and fewer distractions.

But it’s not just the coursework that’s doing a number on me. It’s Jamie. We had our last Ph 1c study group session today, going over those quantum weirdness problems – wave functions and all the delightful impossibility of observing a particle without affecting it. Every time they explained something, their eyes would light up, and I swear I understood the physics better just from watching them. And then they asked if *I* was staying for Thanksgiving, and my response was probably a jumbled mess about "optimizing for P-set completion during peak solitude." Smooth, Trevor. Real smooth.

I mean, I’ve got a proper *crush* on Jamie. A full-on, thermodynamics-defying kind of crush. It’s like my brain, which is usually so good at predicting trajectories and solving differential equations, completely short-circuits whenever they’re around. I spend half my study time mentally replaying our conversations (or rather, my awkward contributions to them) instead of deriving equations for gravitational potential. It’s a real *crush* on my productivity. My internal monologue sounds like a Matlab script running into an infinite loop.

Part of me hopes they’re staying too. Maybe I’ll run into them in the dining hall, or at the Ath, and this time I’ll manage something more coherent than a grunt. Part of me also hopes they *don’t* stay, so I can just focus on my Ma 1c final review and get some mental space back. The internal conflict is intense. This whole freshman year is turning out to be a balancing act between trying to survive academics and trying to figure out how to exist as a normal human being with normal human feelings. Sometimes I think a complex numbers problem is easier to solve than the simple social equation of "how to talk to your crush without sounding like a robot."

Anyway, time to try and unwind. Maybe watch some terrible sci-fi before the library opens again tomorrow morning. Hopefully, the break will help me untangle my thoughts, both physical and emotional.
