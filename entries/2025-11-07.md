Dear diary,

Another Friday, another near-existential crisis averted (mostly). Problem Set 4 in Linear Algebra nearly broke me. Seriously. It was like staring into the abyss of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and the abyss was staring back… mocking me in Greek letters.

But enough about the torture. The real reason I’m writing is about the damn Caltech Y. They’re pushing this whole "dorm unity" thing really hard. This week it's a "dorm-wide study session" in the Avery House common room tonight. Ugh. I appreciate the sentiment, I really do. They want us to feel a sense of *union*, like we're all in this together, battling the GPA-killing coursework and sleep deprivation. But honestly? I work best alone. My study habits are… idiosyncratic. Let’s just say they involve copious amounts of caffeine, dubstep, and occasional screaming at the textbook. Not exactly conducive to a calm and productive group atmosphere.

Plus, it's just…awkward. I barely know anyone in Avery besides my roommate, David, and he’s convinced he can solve the Riemann Hypothesis. Trying to "bond" over determinants with a bunch of strangers just sounds like a recipe for social disaster. I’m pretty sure someone will bring up their high school math team achievements, and I'll suddenly remember I have to dissect a virtual frog for Bio.

However… I did promise David I'd go for at least an hour. He’s really buying into the whole "dorm *union* makes us stronger" thing. And maybe, just maybe, he's right. Maybe I’ll actually learn something. Or at least meet someone who also thinks professor Anderson's proofs are indecipherable. Who knows?

Okay, enough procrastinating. Back to the abyss, before it engulfs me entirely. Wish me luck.

-Trevor
