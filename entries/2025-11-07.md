Dear diary,

Another day, another problem set due tomorrow that I haven't really started. Physics 12 is going to be the death of me, I swear. But that's not what's bugging me tonight. It's... the Glee Club.

Yeah, I know, totally stereotypical Caltech freshman wanting to join Glee Club. But it's actually pretty good! And, okay, yes, maybe a small part of me is hoping to meet someone who *doesn't* dream in Lagrange multipliers.

Anyway, auditions were today. I sang a butchered version of “Mr. Blue Sky.” My voice cracked, I forgot a verse, and I think I saw Professor McElroy (Quantum I, also a surprisingly talented tenor) subtly wince in the back. So, yeah, probably not getting in.

But the bigger issue is the weird tension between the "old guard" of the club and the new auditionees. They were talking about… the future of the club. Apparently, there’s a real split on whether to stick to mostly traditional repertoire or try to incorporate more pop and contemporary music. It sounded like a real struggle to find a *union* between the two factions, a way to honor the club’s history while also making it relevant to a new generation of singers.

Honestly, I felt like an observer at some sort of political negotiation. A small, ridiculously nerdy political negotiation conducted in four-part harmony.

Regardless of whether I get in or not, I hope they can figure it out. A fractured Glee Club… well, that just sounds sad. It should be a place of shared joy, a place where music brings everyone together. If that's gone, what's the point?

Ugh, time to wrestle with those pesky wave functions. Maybe I’ll try singing “Mr. Blue Sky” to them… might scare them into solving themselves.
