Dear diary,

November 17th, 2025. Monday. And what a Monday it’s shaping up to be. My Ph 1a P-set is absolutely *crushing* me. We’re deep into Lagrangian mechanics now, and I swear, Professor Thorne's examples are designed to make us question every life choice that led us to this point. I just spent three hours in the Avery common room trying to derive the equations of motion for a system of coupled oscillators, and I think I ended up with more variables than actual physical meaning. My brain feels like it’s been put through a hydraulic press. My spirit is truly being put to the test.

Just when I thought my mental resilience couldn't be *crushed* any further, something else happened. I was heading back to my room, utterly defeated, when I saw Maya from my Ma 1b section near the Olive Walk. She was laughing with someone about a concept from quantum chemistry – I caught a snippet about wave functions and particle-in-a-box – and she just looked so… vibrant. Even though she was talking about something incredibly complex, she had this genuine, easy smile, and her eyes sparkled in the late afternoon sun.

And just like that, my brain, already a mangled mess from physics, decided to add a whole new kind of *crush* to the mix. It's so stupid. Here I am, a freshman barely surviving the weekly onslaught of P-sets, contemplating the existential dread of a potential F on my next midterm, and now I can't stop thinking about how effortlessly she makes quantum sound fascinating. It’s like my academic *crush* on higher-level physics is warring with this sudden, inconvenient *crush* on a fellow human who also happens to be a genius.

Part of me is annoyed – like, Trevor, focus! You have a differential equation to solve that probably involves some impossible integral! But another part is just… quietly admiring. It's weird. She makes me want to understand quantum chemistry just so I can maybe, just maybe, have a coherent conversation with her about it. Which, let's be honest, is probably just my competitive Caltech brain trying to find an excuse for a new obsession.

I still have two more problems on this P-set to tackle before I can even think about getting a proper dinner. But now, instead of just the fear of failure, there’s this tiny, silly hope that maybe I’ll run into her in the dining hall tonight. Or tomorrow.

This place *crushes* you, but sometimes, just sometimes, it throws a small, unexpected bit of sunshine into the chaos.
