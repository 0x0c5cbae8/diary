Dear diary,

2025-11-24 (Monday)

Another Monday. The alarm, a truly demonic contraption, ripped me from the sweet embrace of a few too-few hours of sleep at 7 AM. Usually, I'm okay by the time I've had my breakfast (read: a lukewarm bagel and questionable coffee from the SAC), but today… today felt different. Heavier.

Ph 1a lecture was a blur of electromagnetism I'll have to re-watch later. Ma 1a recitation was brutal – a new layer of abstraction I swear wasn't in the textbook. And then CS 1 labs for the week dropped, along with the next Ma 1a PSet and a take-home quiz for Ch 1a. It's not just "busy" anymore, diary. It's a full-blown state of *servitude*.

I literally feel like an indentured servant to the Caltech academic calendar. My masters are these damn problem sets, my chains are the ever-shortening deadlines, and my payment is… well, the eventual hope of graduation, I guess? Every task isn't just a task; it's a command I must obey. My brain, my hands, my very existence feels wholly devoted to fulfilling the demands of the various departments. There’s no "optional" work here, no "I'll get to it if I feel like it." It's all absolutely mandatory, absolutely consuming.

I was hunched over the Ma 1a PSet tonight in the common room until nearly 1 AM, the only company being the faint hum of the servers downstairs and the occasional squeak of my chair. My eyes burned, my back ached, and my brain felt like a sponge that had been squeezed dry and then asked to absorb a whole new ocean of information. It's not just the *amount* of work; it's the *intensity*. Each problem demands total intellectual capitulation. You surrender your free will to its logic, hoping it eventually yields to your understanding.

Sometimes I wonder if this is what they mean by "breaking you down to build you back up." Right now, I just feel broken. Like a cog in a massive, infinitely complex machine that just churns out PhDs and Nobel laureates, and I’m just one of the raw materials. The idea of choice, of pursuing my own interests *outside* the prescribed curriculum, feels like a distant, utopian dream. I'm bound to this schedule, these readings, these equations. It's an intellectual prison, albeit one with excellent library resources and surprisingly good coffee if you know where to look.

Got to get at least five hours tonight. Ph 1a PSet is due Wednesday, and I still haven't even *looked* at problem 3. The servitude continues.
