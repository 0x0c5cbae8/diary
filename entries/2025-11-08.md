Dear diary,

Today was... strange. And not the quirky-meeting-a-talking-squirrel strange, but the unsettling, something-feels-wrong strange.

Remember how I was so excited about finally landing that promotion to Head of Product Innovation? Well, I got it. Announced it at the all-hands meeting and everything. Everyone clapped. My boss, Ms. Chen, gave me a genuinely warm smile.

But the clapping felt... hollow. Like it was being performed, not felt. And Ms. Chen's smile, beautiful as always, seemed a little too perfect, a little too… practiced.

Then there's the new AI system we're implementing. "Project Chimera," they're calling it. It’s supposed to streamline workflows, predict market trends, and even brainstorm new product ideas. Sounds amazing, right? Except it’s…too good. It’s like it already knows what I'm thinking before I even think it. I mentioned offhand wanting a new kind of coffee to Kevin in accounting, and Chimera suggested three different blends within five minutes.

I tried to talk to Sarah about it during lunch. She just shrugged and said, "It's the future, Trevor. Get used to it." Her eyes were glazed over, almost like she was reciting a script. I don't know, maybe I'm just paranoid. Maybe I'm just adjusting to the new role.

But the feeling persists. The perfect smiles, the robotic efficiency, the unnervingly prescient AI... Something feels… off. Like we're all living in a simulation, and I'm the only one who can see the glitches.

Maybe I need a vacation. Or maybe, just maybe, I need to dig a little deeper.

-Trevor
