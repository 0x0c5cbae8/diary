Dear diary,

Okay, today was...interesting. Lab was brutal. We spent four hours trying to get the damn fluorescence microscope to cooperate. Honestly, I think the yeast culture was plotting against us. But that's not the interesting part.

The interesting part is that Alice from my physics section was also in the lab today (biophysics overlap, go figure). And she actually *asked me* for help with setting up the excitation wavelength! I pretended I knew exactly what I was doing, which, thankfully, I mostly did thanks to yesterday's excruciating lecture. But she smiled, a real smile, when I finally got it working. And it was...yeah.

I think I might have a tiny, almost imperceptible, but definitely present, crush. It's ridiculous, I know. I've known her for, like, six weeks. And she probably just needed someone who wasn't actively setting things on fire. But her hair was pulled back in a ponytail and she had these really cool earrings that looked like little circuit boards, and she actually understands the difference between Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics...

This whole Caltech thing is way more complicated than just surviving thermo. Food in Chandler sucks, my sleep schedule is a joke, and now I'm apparently developing feelings for the smartest girl I know. College is a mess.

I need to focus. Problem sets, problem sets, problem sets. And maybe figure out a less awkward way to say hello to Alice next time I see her. Perhaps mention the new ramen place near Avery? Too much? Definitely too much.

Ugh. I need sleep.
