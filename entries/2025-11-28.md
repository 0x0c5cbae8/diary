Dear diary,

2025-11-28 (Friday)

Well, Thanksgiving break was a blink and you missed it kind of deal. I ended up staying on campus – figured the travel wasn't worth the hassle for just a couple of days, and the dining hall actually put out a surprisingly decent spread yesterday. Today, though, it’s back to the real world, and oh boy, is it real.

Spent pretty much my entire evening in one of the study rooms in Millikan, wrestling with the newest Physics 1b problem set. We’re deep into electromagnetism now, and my brain feels like it’s been put through a wringer. Dr. Chen’s lectures make it sound so elegant, but then you get to the problems and suddenly you're staring into the abyss.

I swear, the *white*board in that room has seen more of my existential dread than my own pillow. It started out so pristine, a clean slate, full of promise. But within an hour, it was a chaotic mess of vectors, integrals, and scribbled diagrams trying to visualize electric fields. There’s something both terrifying and comforting about it. Terrifying because it perfectly mirrors the jumbled mess inside my head, all these equations vying for space. Comforting because, eventually, you start to see patterns, you erase a wrong turn, and you make progress. Even if it's just a tiny corner of the *white*board that finally makes sense.

After what felt like an eternity, Liam and Chloe joined me. They’d just gotten back from their families and were equally dazed. We spent another two hours collectively assaulting that *white*board, arguing over boundary conditions and flux. I think we finally got the tricky one about the charged sphere inside a grounded conducting shell. It felt like a small victory, a tiny piece of clarity emerging from the *white* haze of complex variables. The sheer amount of *white* paper I've gone through this week, just scratching out ideas before transferring them to the problem set, is also insane. It makes me wonder how much *white* ink goes into printing all these textbooks and notes.

Tomorrow, it's more of the same. Just trying to keep my head above water before finals hit. It’s hard to believe how fast this first term is flying by.
