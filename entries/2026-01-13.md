Dear diary,

Another Tuesday, another metric ton of work. Bio 1 P-set almost broke me today; mapping out that entire Krebs cycle from memory felt like trying to defuse a bomb blindfolded. Then there was the Calc 2 problem involving an integral that looked like it was designed by Cthulhu. My brain feels like a squashed grape.

But the most interesting part of the day, oddly enough, came from Professor Schmidt's Human Physiology lecture. We were covering endocrinology, and the topic of hormonal changes throughout a human lifespan came up. He spent a good twenty minutes on the intricate feedback loops involved in the reproductive system, and then naturally, we got to **menopause**.

It's such a fascinating biological process, really. The gradual decline of ovarian function, the shift in hormone production—estrogen, progesterone—and the systemic effects that ripple through the body. He talked about the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, the neuroendocrine changes, the bone density implications, even the cardiovascular risks. From a purely systems engineering perspective, it's a massive, complex transition, almost like a controlled shutdown sequence in a highly evolved biological machine. And to think, it's a uniquely human (and some other primate) phenomenon in terms of its pronounced impact and duration post-reproduction. It just makes you appreciate the sheer complexity of life, how robust and yet delicate our biological systems are. It's not just a 'stop reproducing' button; it's a whole cascading series of adaptations and changes. I even found myself thinking about the evolutionary reasons why such a process would have persisted, beyond the 'grandmother hypothesis.'

Anyway, that analytical detour aside, I then had three hours in the Physics lab trying to get accurate measurements for the Planck constant using LEDs, which was frustratingly finicky. I swear, the uncertainty in our results was larger than my will to live after four hours of sleep. My brain is definitely nowhere near its 'peak ovarian function' right now, if you catch my drift. More like post-menopausal levels of cognitive output. Kidding, mostly.

Now I just need to debug this Python script for CS 1. It's 1 AM already. Another early morning for a problem session. Coffee is my current endocrine system.
