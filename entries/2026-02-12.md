Dear diary,

Another Thursday has come and gone, though "gone" feels like a strong word when the physics P-set for Friday is still glaring at me from my desk, daring me to attempt that final, monster problem. Physics 11 is just… merciless. And don't even get me started on the Ma 1 bonus questions. I swear Professor Chen designs them specifically to haunt our dreams.

I spent most of the day in classes, then in lab for Chem 1a, where I'm pretty sure I accidentally mixed something I shouldn't have, judging by the weird smell that briefly enveloped our hood. My lab partner, Maya, just gave me *that look*. After that, it was a blur of trying to get through readings and attempting to debug some Python for CS 1. Sleep debt is piling up faster than laundry in my room.

But something else happened tonight that actually managed to pull me away from the crushing weight of deadlines, at least for a little while. I was slumped in the common room, trying to force my brain to process one more differential equation, when Alex, a junior from Fleming, wandered in. He took one look at me and Leo, who was sprawled out equally miserably with his own Linear Algebra book, and just chuckled.

"You guys look like you're about to spontaneously generate an existential crisis," he said. "How about a break?"

We mumbled something about deadlines, but he just leaned against the doorframe, a mischievous glint in his eye. "I have a challenge for you, freshmen. A proper Tech challenge. I *dare* you to figure out how to program the coffee machine in the common room to dispense coffee at precisely 314.15 Kelvin and keep it our secret for a full 24 hours without anyone noticing *how* it's done."

Leo immediately perked up. "314.15 Kelvin? Pi Kelvin? That's just cruel, Alex."
"Exactly," Alex grinned. "It's subtle, it's elegant, and it's practically a Caltech haiku. Can you do it?"

My first thought was, "No way, I barely have time to sleep." My second thought, however, was pure, unadulterated Caltech curiosity. How *would* you interface with that machine? It's got a basic touchscreen, but internally, it's probably running some custom firmware. We'd have to figure out its architecture, maybe reverse-engineer some of its protocols, or find a hidden service port. The idea of subtly changing its parameters without leaving a trace, making it a "ghost in the machine" sort of thing… it just clicked with my brain in a way that Physics P-sets sometimes struggle to.

Maya joined us then, having escaped her own problem set purgatory. When we explained the dare, her eyes narrowed, not in annoyance, but in concentration. "So, temperature control, stealth, and a prime number for extra difficulty. I'm in."

So, for the past two hours, we’ve been huddled around Leo's laptop, googling coffee machine models, looking at industrial control systems, and brainstorming ways to access its internal workings. We've considered everything from a simple Wi-Fi exploit to physically opening it up and trying to flash custom firmware (Alex vetoed the latter for being "too obvious" and "potentially voiding the warranty," which, fair). It's a completely different kind of problem-solving, a hands-on hack that feels so much more *alive* than abstract equations.

This dare is probably going to cost me another few hours of sleep I desperately need, and I still have to finish that P-set. But there's a thrill to it, a collaborative spark that reminds me why I came here. It's not just about acing exams; it's about pushing boundaries, figuring things out, and maybe, just maybe, making a coffee machine dispense Pi Kelvin lattes.

Wish us luck. The mission begins at midnight.
