Dear diary,

January 22, 2026. Thursday. Another day blurring into another night. I swear the sun barely registers on my internal clock anymore. I checked the weather *forecast* this morning – sunny and 70 degrees, apparently. Meanwhile, my *forecast* for the completion of the CS problem set before sunrise was looking decidedly stormy, with a 90% chance of a caffeine-induced meltdown.

Honestly, sometimes I feel like my entire existence here is just a series of frantic forecasts. I’m constantly trying to predict when I’ll next get a full night’s sleep (current *forecast*: sometime in July, maybe), or if I’ll actually understand the quantum mechanics lecture tomorrow (current *forecast*: low probability, high chance of blank stares). Professor Ramirez was talking today about using predictive models for material stress, and all I could think about was my own stress levels. If I tried to *forecast* my mental state right now, it would probably be a graph with sharp peaks of panic and deep troughs of exhaustion, occasionally punctuated by a brief, bewildering moment of clarity when an equation finally clicks.

I just spent three hours wrestling with problem 4 on the PChem p-set. My housemate, Emily, cruised through it in like 45 minutes. Makes me wonder if my *forecast* for passing this quarter is accurate at all, or if I’m just delusionally optimistic. At this rate, my *forecast* for seeing daylight before noon tomorrow is also pretty grim. I’m thinking about making a dedicated "sleep forecast" spreadsheet for my whole freshman year. I have a feeling it'll be mostly zeros and question marks.

Just gotta keep pushing. One more page, one more integral. I can do this. I think.
