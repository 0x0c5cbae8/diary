Dear diary,

Wednesday, December 17th, and I can finally breathe. My brain feels like a deflated balloon after surviving that last Applied Physics final. I actually just walked out of Beckman Auditorium like ten minutes ago. *Done*. Term One at Caltech. Officially over. I'm not entirely sure how I got through it, but I did. The sheer volume of information, the P-sets that felt like they were actively trying to break my spirit, the late nights fueled by questionable coffee and sheer stubbornness… it was all real. And now it’s done.

The first thing I did after dropping my backpack in my Fleming room wasn't to collapse on my bed (though that was a strong contender). No, I headed straight for the practice room in the basement. It’s been weeks, probably since mid-October, since I’ve had a proper session. Pulled out my **cello**, carefully easing it from its case. The dark wood felt smooth and familiar against my cheek as I tuned it, the low, resonant hum a stark contrast to the buzzing in my head from all those equations.

I didn't try to tackle anything complicated. Just the Prelude from Bach's Cello Suite No. 1. The moment my bow drew across the G string, and that first deep, soulful note filled the small room, it was like a physical release. All the tension, all the mental clutter from thermodynamics and linear algebra, just… melted away. The rich, vibrating tones were so grounding, so utterly *human*. It’s a completely different kind of problem-solving than anything I do in class – intuitive, emotional, deeply satisfying. My fingers, surprisingly, remembered the muscle memory, gliding over the fingerboard, finding the perfect pitch.

I sometimes wonder why I bother lugging the cello all the way out here, why I carve out precious, almost non-existent time for it. But moments like this, after the relentless grind of finals, make it crystal clear. It's not just a hobby; it's an anchor. A reminder that there’s a world beyond derivations and debugging, a world of harmony and beauty that actually *recharges* me. It makes the silence after the final note feel profound, not just empty.

Anyway, I’m rambling. My flight home for winter break is tomorrow morning. I think I’m going to spend a good chunk of the break just playing, letting my brain decompress with something other than coding or calculus. Maybe I'll even try to learn a new piece. For now, though, I'm just going to savor this feeling of accomplishment, and the lingering vibrations of that last C major chord.
