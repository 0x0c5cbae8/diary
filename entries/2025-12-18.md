Dear diary,

It's over. It's actually, truly over. Thursday, December 18th, and I just stumbled out of my last final – Ma 1c. My brain feels like it’s been put through a meat grinder and then reassembled incorrectly. But it’s done. Fall quarter is done.

I don't think I properly understood the word "class" until I got to Caltech. In high school, it was just a period in the day, a subject you showed up for. Here, a *class* is an all-encompassing entity, a relentless wave of problem sets, lectures that move at light speed, and exams designed to humble even the most brilliant minds. This quarter, every single *class* felt like a marathon. Ph 1c and Ch 1c were their own special brands of torment, but Ma 1c for the final act? Pure brutality.

Walking out of Ramo, past the pool, I just wanted to lie down on the grass and not move for a week. But instead, there was this incredible lightness. It wasn't just the relief of finishing *a* final, but finishing *all* the finals. Finishing the entire first *class* of courses that define a Caltech freshman. It's like we all just survived a trial by fire. You look around at the other zombies shuffling out, and there's a silent understanding. We're all in this *class* of freshmen, and we just passed our first big test together. It's a strange kind of bond forged through shared suffering.

I'm packing up now, trying to decide what sparse belongings to take home for the break. A part of me is already dreading the thought of coming back for winter quarter and starting up with a whole new set of *classes*. But another part – the slightly insane Caltech part – is also a little bit excited. What new concepts will blow my mind? What new challenges will make me question my life choices?

For now, though, glorious, blissful, academic freedom for a few weeks. I might actually remember what it feels like to sleep more than 4 hours a night. Maybe even read something that isn't a textbook.
