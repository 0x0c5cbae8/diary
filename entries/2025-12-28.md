Dear diary,

December 28th, 2025. Sunday. Already. Winter break is evaporating faster than liquid nitrogen in a warm lab. Today was… slow. Gloriously slow. Mostly spent on the couch, contemplating the thermodynamics of my own *digestion*.

See, Grandma went all out for Christmas dinner yesterday, and then insisted on sending me off with enough leftovers to feed a small army of sleep-deprived engineers. So, today was a marathon of turkey, mashed potatoes, and three different kinds of pie. My stomach has been working overtime, a veritable biochemical factory, processing the sheer volume of delicious, caloric input. It’s a stark contrast to my usual Caltech dietary experience.

Back on campus, it often felt like my actual physical *digestion* was an afterthought. My brain was too busy trying to *digest* problem sets and dense lecture material – trying to break down complex proofs and abstract concepts into something my neuron-based system could process. Meals were often a race against the clock, fueled by whatever vending machine miracle or late-night ramen could be procured before the next p-set deadline. My gut flora must be in utter chaos from the inconsistent fuel sources and high-stress environment. I swear, the only thing my digestive tract consistently received was caffeine.

Coming home, with real, home-cooked food and the luxury of actually *sitting down* to eat, my body feels like it’s finally getting a chance to recalibrate. It’s not just the food; it’s the lack of constant mental strain. My brain, too, is getting a chance to *digest* everything from the past term, not just rapidly absorb and excrete information for an exam. It’s a different kind of processing, a more relaxed, thorough breakdown of knowledge that actually feels... nourishing.

Soon enough, it'll be back to campus, and my "digestive system" – both literal and metaphorical – will be put to the test again. But for now, I'm just enjoying the comfort, letting my internal machinery work at a more leisurely pace. My stomach just rumbled in agreement.
