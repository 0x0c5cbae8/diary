Dear diary,

Another Sunday bleeds into another night, and I swear the fluorescent hum from my desk lamp is a physical manifestation of my brain trying to process every single differential equation from Physics 1a. It’s December 14th, which means the final is looming like a black hole, ready to swallow all my carefully constructed understanding of the universe.

Today was supposed to be about solidifying concepts, but it quickly devolved into a brutal wrestling match with an old problem set from Week 7. It was a kinematics problem involving a projectile with air resistance, and the professor had *insisted* on us accounting for all the minor variables. I spent three hours on it, meticulously deriving the equations of motion, plugging in the values, double-checking the integration steps. My first answer for the maximum height was off by nearly 10%. "Okay," I thought, "a sign error, maybe a misplaced constant, I’ll find it."

But no. After an hour of backtracking, I found it. A tiny, almost imperceptible mistake in the initial boundary conditions – I'd assumed a perfectly smooth surface for an initial push, when the problem statement *explicitly* mentioned a tiny coefficient of static friction for the *first meter* of the push. It was a fraction of a percent difference in the initial velocity component, but by the time it propagated through the entire derivation and subsequent numerical integration, it threw everything off. Ten percent! All because I wasn't accurate enough in *reading the damn problem* right at the very beginning.

That’s the thing about Caltech, isn’t it? It’s not just about understanding the principles; it's about the excruciating demand for *accuracy*. Not just close enough, not "within an order of magnitude," but precisely, ruthlessly accurate. My high school physics teacher would have shrugged at a 10% discrepancy and said, "Good enough for government work, you got the concept!" Here, that's a failing grade on a lab, or a project that crashes and burns. It makes me question if my internal model of how things work is truly accurate, or if I'm just getting by on rough approximations that will inevitably fail under scrutiny.

It's exhausting, this constant vigilance. Every significant figure, every negative sign, every subtle distinction in a problem statement feels like a high-stakes gamble. Sometimes I wish I could just… approximate. Just get the gist. But then I remember why I came here – for the rigor, for the challenge, for the kind of knowledge that stands up to real-world testing. Because in the real world, building a bridge or launching a satellite or designing a drug, "good enough" isn't good enough. Accuracy isn't a suggestion; it's a requirement.

I suppose it’s a good lesson. A painful, sleep-depriving lesson, but a good one. Now, to re-derive that solution for the tenth time, making absolutely sure every single subscript and superscript is exactly where it should be. And maybe get some sleep before tomorrow's final push.
