Dear diary,

Another Saturday, another P-set. My brain feels like it’s running on fumes, trying to wrap itself around the Navier-Stokes equations for Fluids, and I’m pretty sure I dreamt in partial derivatives last night. It's 2 AM on Sunday technically, but it's still Saturday in my head until this Physics 2a monstrosity is submitted.

Oh, right. It's February 14th. Valentine's Day. I vaguely remember seeing some incredibly dry-erase marker art of a heart on a whiteboard in the study lounge earlier, captioned "Love is the first derivative of friendship, with respect to time." Very Caltech.

Normally, I'd completely ignore it, but even the Houses get into the spirit – in their own way, of course. For Valentine's, Blacker decided on a "Great Grilled Cheese Gauntlet." Basically, they hauled out about five panini presses and several industrial-sized blocks of various cheeses, encouraging us to take a break from our P-sets for a "fortifying, non-romantic, carbohydrate-and-fat loading experience." Genius, really.

I finally dragged myself downstairs around midnight. The common room was a glorious mess of crumbs, melted cheese strings, and the aroma of toasted bread. Someone had rigged up a projector playing a loop of clips from bad romantic comedies, muted, while classical music played from another speaker. Classic Tech-er chaos.

I made myself a masterpiece. Sharp white **cheddar** on sourdough, with a hint of pepper jack for a kick, grilled to golden perfection. Honestly, it was the best thing I'd eaten all day, probably all week. As I stood there, munching my sandwich, staring blankly at a particularly sappy scene on the muted projector, I started thinking about the cheddar itself. Its molecular structure, how the fats emulsify when heated, the lactic acid bacteria that give it that tang. It's such a reliable cheese, isn't it? Consistent, robust, comforting. Kind of like this place, in a weird way. Always there, always demanding, but occasionally offering a moment of unexpected, cheesy warmth when you least expect it.

It reminded me that even amidst the P-sets, the late nights, and the general academic grind, there are these small, quirky moments of connection and sustenance. A shared laugh over a bad movie, the satisfying crunch of perfectly toasted bread, the reliable comfort of a good block of **cheddar**. Who needs romance when you have good dairy, right?

Alright, time to brave the final few problems. My stomach is full, my brain is... slightly less empty. Maybe I'll actually get some sleep before sunrise. Happy whatever-it-is-tomorrow.
