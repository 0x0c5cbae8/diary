Dear diary,

Another Tuesday, another descent into the existential void of a Physics 2 p-set. Woke up feeling like I’d been run over by a tank full of textbooks. That dream where I was trapped in a Fourier transform and couldn't integrate my way out? Yeah, that one again. Still, managed to drag myself to Chem lab (pretty sure I almost set something on fire, but the TA looked too tired to notice) and then that dreaded afternoon lecture for Ma 1c. It's a miracle how much information they expect us to absorb without our brains melting into a puddle of differential equations.

But the real challenge, as always, came after dinner: the aforementioned Physics 2 p-set. We’re on electromagnetism now, and my brain just wants to *resist*. Literally. I spent a good hour staring at a problem about a current loop in a magnetic field, feeling utterly useless. Just when I was about to throw my textbook out the window of Page House, Liam showed up.

Liam is my designated study **buddy** for Physics 2. We kind of gravitated towards each other during orientation week – both equally terrified, both equally convinced we were about to be exposed as admissions mistakes. Turns out, having a **buddy** isn't just about commiserating. It's about collective brainpower.

We spent the next four hours huddled over our whiteboards, scribbling equations, erasing them, trying again. There were moments of frustration, sure. "Did you even *read* the problem statement, Trevor?" he'd groan, or I'd retort with "Your algebra is a crime against humanity, Liam!" But then there were those glorious breakthroughs. He’d spot a symmetry I missed, or I’d catch a sign error in his calculation. We’d bounce ideas off each other, explaining concepts until one of us finally understood.

Honestly, I don't know how I'd survive Caltech without a **buddy** like Liam. It's not just the p-sets, though those are life-savers. It's knowing there's someone else in the trenches with you. Someone who understands the particular brand of exhaustion that comes from calculating the electric field of a uniformly charged sphere at 2 AM. Someone to grab late-night coffee with, or just vent about the general insanity of it all.

It makes everything just a little bit more bearable, a little less lonely. Even when we're both staring blankly at Maxwell's equations, at least we're doing it together. And tonight, thanks to our combined efforts, we actually *finished* the p-set. Only five minutes before the submission deadline, of course. That's the Caltech way.

Time for some much-needed sleep. Tomorrow, a fresh batch of problems, and another session with my favorite academic **buddy**.
