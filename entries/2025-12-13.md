Dear diary,

Ugh, it’s Saturday. Or what passes for Saturday when you’re a frosh at Caltech. My brain feels less like a functional neural network and more like a burnt-out circuit board after this week. Just submitted the Bio 1 lab report on microbial growth curves. I swear I saw more *E. coli* than sunlight this week.

But you know, something from Professor Davies’ lecture today, or maybe it was in the reading for the final, actually stuck with me despite the general brain-fried haze. The concept of "in vivo." We’d been talking about it, comparing it to "in vitro" studies – the sterile petri dish, the controlled environment, the isolated system. And then you have *in vivo* experiments. Within the living. The messiness, the interconnectedness, the sheer, undeniable *life* of it. All the confounding variables, the unforeseen interactions, the elegant yet chaotic complexity of an actual organism.

And it just hit me, diary, that my entire Caltech experience so far feels incredibly "in vivo." Before I got here, I guess I imagined it would be more *in vitro*. A perfectly controlled academic environment. My studies, my room, my problem sets, all neatly isolated and manageable. But it’s not like that at all.

It’s an overwhelming, dynamic, utterly *alive* system. There's the constant stress of classes, the social dynamics of Blacker House, the sudden late-night debugging sessions with my study group, the weird interactions with actual human beings outside of a textbook (who knew?), the unexpected bursts of inspiration, the crushing blows of a bad midterm grade, the faint glimmer of a UROP possibility on the horizon. It’s all happening *within* a living, breathing context – me. And Caltech itself.

It’s not clean, it’s not always predictable, and sometimes I feel like I’m just a tiny data point in a vast, complex experiment. But watching those cells grow, knowing that *in vivo* is where the real magic – and the real challenges – happen, it made me think. Maybe this chaotic, sleep-deprived, intensely stimulating existence is what "living" really feels like. Not just surviving, but truly existing within a constantly evolving system.

Still, wouldn't mind a little more *in vitro* relaxation for a change. Maybe a nap.
