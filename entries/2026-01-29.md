Dear diary,

Another Thursday down, which means another day closer to the inevitable mental meltdown or breakthrough, whichever comes first. It’s 1:47 AM, and I’m pretty sure I’m running on fumes and the lingering scent of stale coffee from Millikan.

Today’s torment, or rather, my self-imposed challenge, revolved entirely around the concept of **retouching**. Not in the Glamour Shots kind of way, obviously. My CS 121 project involves building a small, low-power system to identify objects in my dorm room – starting with the absolute thrill of knowing when I’m out of milk. Simple, right? Just point a camera, train a model, and bam, smart fridge.

Except, "simple" at Caltech is a myth. The problem isn't the model itself, it's the sheer garbage quality of the input data. My tiny Raspberry Pi camera, wedged precariously on a shelf, provides images that are dark, blurry, and plagued by reflections from the plastic containers and the fridge light. My object detection algorithm was failing spectacularly because it was trying to make sense of what looked like abstract art.

So, I spent the last eight hours trying to effectively "retouch" these abysmal raw images. It started with simple things – adjusting brightness, contrast, trying to apply some adaptive histogram equalization to pull out features from the gloom. Then it escalated. I was writing Python scripts to dynamically mask out specular highlights, experimenting with different noise reduction filters, even attempting some rudimentary perspective correction because the camera's never quite straight. It felt less like image processing and more like forensic photography, trying to extract a clear image of a half-gallon of 2% from a digital crime scene.

And then there's the other kind of retouching: my code. Every time I thought I had a decent pre-processing pipeline, I'd run it through the detection model, and it would still choke. So then I'd have to go back and "retouch" the parameters of my YOLOv3 implementation, adjusting confidence thresholds, re-evaluating anchor box sizes, even tweaking the learning rate. It's a continuous cycle of refine, test, fail, and then refine again. It makes me realize that nothing, absolutely nothing, works perfectly out of the box. Everything needs that iterative process of improvement, that careful, persistent act of **retouching** to get it just right.

Honestly, I feel like my own brain needs some serious retouching after today. Probably some neural network retraining, a memory defragmentation, and certainly a major sleep patch. I overheard someone talking about the upcoming midterms for Quantum Mechanics and Linear Algebra, and I swear I felt a piece of my soul spontaneously combust. Guess I'll be "retouching" my notes and problem sets this weekend instead of, you know, sleeping.

Still, there’s a perverse satisfaction in seeing a slightly clearer image of that milk carton after hours of struggle. Maybe by next week, my fridge will actually be smarter than I am.
