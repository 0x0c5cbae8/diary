Dear diary,

Another Wednesday night bleeding into Thursday morning. I swear, the only thing more constant than the hum of the fridge in my room is the feeling of existential dread building towards the next P-set deadline. Ph 1b lab report on interferometry is due tomorrow, and my brain feels like it’s been through a particle accelerator – scattered and exhausted.

We spent the afternoon debugging our Michaelson interferometer, and I’m pretty sure the laser had a personal vendetta against my sanity. It kept drifting, the mirrors were misaligned, and at one point, I thought I saw a faint glow that definitely wasn't supposed to be there. But, through sheer stubbornness (and a gallon of lukewarm coffee), we got the fringes to cooperate. The data looks... plausible. "Plausible" is often the highest praise one can hope for here.

The real challenge tonight wasn't the physics, though. It was the presentation for our conceptual design project in EE 2. Professor Davies is big on "making your ideas visually impactful," which, for me, usually means drawing slightly neater circuit diagrams. Our team decided to build a physical model of our proposed "adaptive drone swarm navigation system." Mostly, it’s a bunch of 3D-printed drone shells glued to a plywood base, representing the swarm. It looked… well, it looked like a bunch of toy drones glued to a board. Functional, but not exactly "impactful."

I was tasked with making it look less like a kindergartener’s diorama and more like something a prestigious research institute might display. After hours of trying to spray-paint the plywood base without inhaling too many fumes, I still felt it was missing something. I rummaged through the communal house supplies bin in the basement – you know, the one full of leftover decoration scraps from Interhouse events and forgotten club paraphernalia. Amidst a tangle of fairy lights and deflated balloons, I found it: a long, surprisingly sturdy strip of iridescent fabric, about six inches wide. It must have been part of some old house banner or maybe a competition winner's prize from years ago. It wasn't quite a ribbon, too broad and stiff for that. It was definitely a *sash*.

I figured, why not? With a moment of sleep-deprived inspiration, I draped the metallic, purple-green *sash* diagonally across the plywood base, securing it with some discreet double-sided tape. It created this unexpected, almost regal contrast against the matte grey of the painted board and the white of the drone shells. It doesn't *do* anything for the navigation system, of course. It doesn't explain the algorithms or the sensor arrays. But it adds a certain... aesthetic gravitas. A bit of showmanship. It elevates the whole thing from "school project" to "school project with a fancy, shimmering band of honor."

Maybe Professor Davies will appreciate the attempt at visual flair. Or maybe he'll just wonder why I've put a piece of old costume regalia on my drone model. Either way, it makes me feel a tiny bit better about the hours I’ve poured into this thing. Time for about four hours of sleep before my 8 AM lecture. Wish me luck.
