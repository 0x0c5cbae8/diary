Dear diary,

Wednesday. November 19th, 2025. Another one bites the dust, or at least tries to. My brain feels like it’s been put through a centrifuge today. Ph 12 lecture was a blur of quantum mechanics, then a CS 12 lab where the compiler decided to go rogue – standard Caltech Tuesday, I guess.

The highlight – or lowlight, depending on how you look at it – was definitely the Ph 12 problem set session tonight. Sarah, Kevin, and I holed up in one of the common rooms for four hours, wrestling with the final problem. It was a beast. We went through two entire *sheets* of scratch paper, crumpled and discarded, before migrating to the main whiteboard. That thing became our battlefield. Equations sprawled, diagrams tangled, arrows pointed in every direction. The pristine **white** surface slowly filled with a chaotic symphony of black and blue marker, each stroke a desperate attempt to unlock the next step. At one point, Sarah accidentally wiped a crucial derivation with her sleeve, and we all just stared at the sudden blank **white** space, like it had swallowed our progress whole. It took us another hour to get back to where we were. The stress was truly **white-hot**.

I swear, by the time we finally cracked it, the fluorescent lights reflecting off the now-glowing **white** board felt almost blinding. My eyes are still aching from staring at it, trying to make sense of the scribbles. Sometimes I fantasize about just staring at a completely **white** wall, with absolutely nothing written on it, no problems to solve, no theories to debunk. Just… empty.

But then I wouldn't be at Caltech, would I?

Anyway, gotta try and get some sleep. Tomorrow's another day for more scientific battles.
