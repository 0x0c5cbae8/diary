Dear diary,

January 30th, 2026. Friday. Another week bites the dust, or rather, another chunk of my dwindling brain cells does. Ph 1a problem set submitted, thankfully, though I’m still convinced there’s a sign error in my Lorentz transformations that will haunt me. Ma 1b is gearing up for a midterm next week, and my brain feels like a perpetually overwrought CPU fan.

Spent the entire afternoon in the Ay 1a lab, trying to calibrate that new electron-multiplying CCD for the optical telescope project. The thing is a beast – incredibly precise, but also incredibly fragile. Dr. Chen practically hovered, watching us like a hawk. Every connection, every mirror alignment, every tiny turn of the micrometer screw had to be done with the utmost care. I found myself *cosseting* each component, cradling the diffraction grating like it was a newborn quantum entanglement, wiping down the lenses with special, non-abrasive solution, barely breathing lest a rogue dust particle settle on the sensor. It demanded absolute focus, absolute gentleness. One wrong move, and hours of data (and thousands of dollars in equipment) could be toast. The stakes felt impossibly high, all for a tiny bump on a spectral line.

As I meticulously secured the final fiber optic cable into its housing, I had this sudden, almost absurd thought: "If only someone would *cosset* me with such devotion." Seriously, diary. My bed in Lloyd House is a functional slab, my diet is 90% instant ramen and whatever caffeine I can get my hands on, and my brain feels like it's been put through a particle accelerator every single day since September. There's no pampering here, no gentle handling, no one shielding me from the harsh realities of differential equations or the existential dread of upcoming midterms. We're expected to just... function. Optimize. Survive. And thrive, apparently.

The irony isn't lost on me. I treat a piece of advanced optics with more tender care than I treat my own rapidly deteriorating sleep schedule. Maybe that's the Caltech way – pour all your delicate attention into the universe's mysteries, and hope your own physical shell doesn't completely disintegrate in the process. Just finished the problem set for Ma 1b, so at least that's one less thing hanging over my head. Now, if only I could apply the same 'cosseting' logic to my pillow for the next six hours. Wishful thinking. Probably dream in spectral lines tonight.
