Dear diary,

Monday. Already feels like a week, and it’s barely past lunchtime. I swear, the only thing keeping me going is caffeine and the sheer terror of falling behind. Chem 1a lecture this morning was a blur of quantum mechanics – electrons apparently have preferences I just can’t wrap my own preferences around. Then Physics 1c, and I’m pretty sure Professor Thorne was speaking fluent alien.

I spent my lunch break holed up in Dabney, trying to get a head start on the Bio 1 lab report due tomorrow. We’re working with preserved specimens this week, specifically a rather unfortunate rat. As I was carefully identifying the different cranial bones, meticulously trying to diagram the sutures, I just kept thinking about its little *skullcap*. The way it perfectly encases something so vital, so complex. It's fascinating, but also a bit... unsettling. My own skullcap feels like it's barely containing the sheer volume of information being crammed in these days. Sometimes I feel like it's going to pop right off, or maybe just melt from the inside out.

It's weird, though. Even with the sleep deprivation and the constant mental gymnastics, there’s a part of me that finds this all so incredibly cool. To be able to look at something so fundamental, like a rat's cranium, and understand the intricate engineering behind it. It makes the headache from the quantum mechanics feel almost worth it. Almost.

I've still got a coding assignment to tackle tonight and a Calc problem set that's threatening to eat my entire evening. Maybe I'll just draw a tiny safety helmet on my own mental skullcap before I dive into the debugging abyss. Wish me luck.
