Dear diary,

Ugh, today was rough. Circuits 101 is officially trying to kill me. Professor Huang’s last lecture was a barrage of Kirchoff’s laws and phasor diagrams that might as well have been written in Klingon. I swear, half the class was glazed over, and the other half was frantically trying to copy down things they didn't understand. Including me.

Then there was the incident at Chandler. I went to grab lunch with Sarah (physics, brilliant, wears the coolest Star Trek shirts) and as I was reaching for a veggie burger, I saw *him*. Kevin from my frosh orientation group. He was wearing a bright orange...thing...on his head. At first, I thought it was some kind of futuristic beanie, maybe some kind of advanced head warmer thing he was trying to prototype. But up close...it was a skullcap. A bright, florescent orange skullcap.

I almost choked on my kale. I mean, okay, maybe it’s a fashion statement. Maybe he’s trying to express his individuality in a sea of Caltech hoodies. But the sheer *intensity* of the orange, combined with his perpetual nervous twitch, was just… unsettling. Sarah just gave me a knowing look and whispered, "Engineers."

I spent the rest of the afternoon trying to figure out if this was some elaborate prank, a signal to some secret Caltech society, or if Kevin just really, really liked bright orange skullcaps. It's messing with my brain more than RC circuits, I swear. I need to focus on my problem set. Maybe that orange skullcap will solve a differential equation in my dreams tonight. If I manage to get any sleep at all.

-Trevor
