Dear diary,
November 23rd, 2025. Sunday.

Another Sunday evening, and my brain feels like it’s been put through a garbage disposal. Not just from the sheer volume of Physics 1b problems I still need to wrestle with before morning, or the existential dread of staring at a blank page for my Ma 1c proof, but also because my thumb is throbbing like it’s got its own heartbeat. I’ve got a massive, angry *blister* right there on the pad, a souvenir from my deep dive into the machine shop this weekend.

It was for the ME 10 project – building that miniature autonomous rover. I spent probably twelve hours straight yesterday trying to get the housing just right for the sensors. So much filing, so much sanding, trying to get the edges perfectly flush. My hands are not meant for this level of precision manual labor, apparently. The blister started small, a tiny red spot, but by the time I finally dragged myself back to Lloyd late last night, it had blossomed into this tender, fluid-filled mountain range on my skin.

Every time I try to grip my pencil, or type, or even just lean my head on my hand while contemplating the mysteries of quantum mechanics, it reminds me of the hours. Hours spent, not on *thinking* (which is what I thought Caltech was mostly about), but on repetitive, frustrating physical work. It’s a literal friction injury, a physical manifestation of the friction I feel trying to adapt to this place. Everything feels like it's rubbing me raw – the relentless pace, the constant imposter syndrome whispering in my ear, the never-ending p-sets.

I keep telling myself this is part of the "experience," that someday I'll look back on these blistered hands and laugh. But right now, with a caffeine headache brewing and that Ma 1c problem staring me down, all I want is a good night’s sleep and a thumb that doesn't feel like it's hosting a tiny, painful rave.

Guess I'll have to duct-tape it or something before I tackle the rest of the problem set. The grind never stops.
