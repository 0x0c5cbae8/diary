Dear diary,

Sunday again. January 4th. Can't believe break is already over and we’re plunged back into winter term. Woke up this morning feeling a strange mix of refreshed and utterly daunted. Mostly daunted. I’ve barely finished unpacking, and I’m already staring down a mountain of problem sets that mock my fleeting sense of peace.

And it got me thinking about ambition. A lot. I remember when I applied to Caltech, my ambition felt like this massive, blazing sun inside me. I wanted to build fusion reactors, cure cancer, send probes to interstellar space – the works. It was all so grand and pure, fueled by late-night Wikipedia binges and the sheer wonder of science.

Now, after a few months here, "ambition" feels less like a sun and more like... well, a very high-powered laser that occasionally burns a hole right through my confidence. Everyone here is so incredibly brilliant, and their ambitions are equally staggering. I sat in on a study group last night for Ma 1b, and some of the guys were casually talking about a research project they’re already contributing to, or how they’re planning to double major in astrophysics and computational neuroscience while also founding a startup. My ambition to just *understand* the Lagrange multiplier method feels embarrassingly small in comparison.

Is that what Caltech does to you? Does it make you question if your ambition is big enough, sharp enough, relentless enough? Or does it make you redefine it? I came here wanting to change the world. Now, some days, I just want to finish my physics problem set without crying, get four hours of sleep, and maybe, just maybe, understand why my code isn't compiling.

Part of me feels guilty for this shift. Like I’m losing some essential drive. But another part wonders if maybe this is a necessary recalibration. Maybe true ambition isn't always about the grandest, most visible achievement, but about the relentless, often invisible, pursuit of understanding. It’s about not giving up on that obscure differential equation, even when your brain feels like static. It's about finding the small, quiet satisfaction in finally grasping a concept that seemed impossible an hour ago.

I suppose my ambition right now is to survive winter term with my sanity mostly intact and to maybe, just maybe, learn something profound along the way. And to find a decent cup of coffee. That feels pretty ambitious too, considering the state of my sleep schedule.

Time to tackle that problem set. Wish me luck.
