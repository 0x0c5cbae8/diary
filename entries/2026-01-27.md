Dear diary,

Ugh, it’s already past 1 AM on Tuesday, or rather, Wednesday technically. My brain feels like it’s been through a centrifuge thanks to this Ph 1b p-set. Electromagnetism is… not always my best friend. I swear, Gauss’s Law and Ampère’s Law conspire against my sleep schedule every week. I finally got a handle on the last problem, involving a very annoyingly shaped current loop, but it took way longer than it should have.

After wrestling with vector potentials for what felt like an eternity, I decided to reward myself with five minutes of doom-scrolling, which, naturally, led me to my inbox. Buried under a dozen club announcements and a reminder about the laundromat (oops, that’s another battle for tomorrow), was an email from the Caltech Y. Subject line: "Special Guest Speaker: Rep. Evelyn Hayes on Science, Innovation, and Policy."

Rep. Evelyn Hayes. A *congressman*. Seriously? Right now, all I care about is whether I’ve correctly calculated the magnetic field on the axis of a solenoid, not the intricacies of federal funding for quantum computing. And yet, reading it, it sort of hit me. All this insane grind, all these late nights pouring over equations, the dream of one day actually *building* something or *discovering* something – it all, at some level, depends on people like her. It depends on whether they understand why pure research matters, why basic science isn't just a luxury.

I guess it's easy to get lost in the weeds here, to just focus on the next p-set, the next exam, the next project deadline. But seeing that email, about a real-life *congressman* coming to talk about "Innovation and Policy," was a strange little jolt. It's a reminder that the work we do here, even the stuff that makes me want to pull my hair out, has a bigger context. It's not just about getting an A; it's about pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and that needs support from, well, people who make decisions about where the money goes.

Okay, deep thoughts over. My brain is officially too fried for existential pondering about the nexus of science and government. Time to try and get a few hours of sleep before Ph 1b lecture at 9 AM. I hope I remembered to actually *turn in* that p-set online. I’ll check in the morning.
