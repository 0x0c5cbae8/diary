Dear diary,

It’s Friday, December 5th, and honestly, the only thing remotely "free" about this Friday is the feeling of existential dread that somehow still manages to find space in my already overcrowded brain. I swear, they should rename the Caltech academic calendar "The Quarter of Perpetual Indebtedness." It feels like I've signed away my soul, my sleep, and any semblance of a social life to the great academic machine.

This whole freshman year, but especially this relentless fall term, has been an exercise in what I can only describe as high-functioning servitude. I'm an indentured servant to the physics department, a data-entry drone for the chemistry lab, and a hapless slave to the relentless demands of my math PSETs. Just yesterday, I spent six hours staring at a differential equation for Ma 1a, feeling less like a student and more like I was being psychologically tortured by an abstract concept. My time isn't my own; it's meticulously parceled out by lecture schedules, lab sessions, mandatory study group meetings, and the looming spectre of final exams that are now just days away.

The ironic part is, I *chose* this. I applied to Caltech, dreamed of coming here, and now I’m here, often feeling like I’m in forced labor, voluntarily. Last night, debugging a C++ program for CS 1 for the fifth hour straight, I had this vivid image of myself chained to my desk, the glowing IDE my unyielding master, demanding perfection pixel by pixel. We’re supposed to be future innovators, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, yet most days, I feel utterly bound by the established methods and the sheer volume of work designed, it seems, to keep us perpetually exhausted and compliant.

Even now, instead of enjoying a moment of quiet reflection, my mind is already calculating the optimal sleep-to-study ratio for the weekend, mapping out when I can cram in the quantum mechanics reading and still get to the instrument calibrations before the lab closes. My master, the institution, still has many tasks for me. And like any good, albeit perpetually tired, servant, I suppose I'll answer the call.
