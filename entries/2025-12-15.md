Dear diary,

Ugh, Mondays. Especially Mondays when finals are *actually* looming. It's December 15th, and I swear the air here is already thick with the static charge of collective anxiety. Or maybe that's just the leftover ozone from yesterday’s lab experiment still lingering in my hair.

Today was a marathon of P-sets and review sessions. My brain feels like it’s been put through a particle accelerator, then reassembled incorrectly. The Physics 1a final is on Wednesday, and I’ve spent the better part of the day wrestling with a particularly nasty problem involving **attraction**. Not the romantic kind, though sometimes I wish that was the hardest problem I had to solve. No, this is all about gravitational forces, orbital mechanics, and the sheer *pull* objects exert on each other. We even dipped into electrostatic attraction in the afternoon recitation, calculating the forces between charged particles. It’s fascinating, honestly. The elegance of the equations, the way they describe something so fundamental and pervasive in the universe. There's a real, almost magnetic, *attraction* for me in trying to unravel these complex systems. It's frustrating as hell when you're stuck, but that moment when it clicks? That's pure dopamine, straight to the hippocampus.

But it got me thinking, while I was trying to figure out why the moon isn’t constantly falling into the Earth (or is it? My brain hurts), about other kinds of attraction. There’s the undeniable *attraction* of my bed right now, after pulling an almost all-nighter. There’s the subtle *attraction* of the smell of coffee wafting from The Grind, pulling me away from my desk even when I know I shouldn’t. And then there's the more profound intellectual *attraction* to a specific research topic I heard about in a lunch talk – something about bio-inspired robotics, which sounds impossibly cool. It's got a gravitational pull that almost makes me forget about the P-set for a second. Almost.

Then there’s the human kind. I saw Maya in the common room earlier, working on her CS P-set, probably something incomprehensible to me with all its Python sorcery. She looked completely absorbed, hair tied up in a messy bun, the usual array of empty Red Bull cans around her. I felt... a familiar, gentle *attraction* to her focused intensity, to her quick wit. It’s not a gravitational pull that scales with mass, or an electrostatic force governed by charge. It’s something far more subtle, harder to quantify, yet just as real. Maybe even more so, because it’s not something I can just plug numbers into a formula for. I wondered if she feels any kind of similar attraction to the chaotic energy I probably exude when I'm debugging my own code or trying to explain quantum tunneling to a rubber duck. Probably not. She's probably just attracted to getting her P-set done.

Anyway, back to the P-set. The gravitational attraction of a passing grade is far stronger than any other force right now. Time to generate some potential energy for tomorrow's work.
