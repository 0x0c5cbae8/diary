Dear diary,

2025-11-21. Friday. Usually, that word would bring a sigh of pure, unadulterated relief, wouldn't it? But here at Caltech, Friday just means the start of a marathon, not the end of a sprint. More like the starting gun for the *real* sprint. My desk is currently a biohazard of half-empty coffee cups, crumpled scratch paper, and a physics textbook that seems to mock me with its pristine, un-highlighted pages.

I’ve been staring at problem 4c on the Ph 2b p-set for what feels like an eternity. Something about coupled oscillators and Lagrangian mechanics, and my brain has decided it's had enough for the night. Or the week. Or the term. The equations just dance on the page, refusing to yield their secrets. Honestly, trying to derive the correct generalized coordinates feels like attempting to decipher an ancient, cryptic decree from some all-powerful, capricious **sultan**. A sultan who delights in making his subjects—namely, me—suffer through nights of calculus-induced despair. His "royal edicts" (aka the p-set questions) are clear enough on the surface, but the underlying logic is a labyrinth designed specifically to humble mere mortals. I swear, the professor must laugh maniacally while writing these.

Just when I was about to declare my academic caliphate over and surrender to the sweet embrace of YouTube distractions, Dave from next door barged in. "Trevor! You alive in there? Group session for Ma 2b starts in ten, and I heard there's leftover pizza from the AIAA meeting downstairs!"

So much for contemplating ancient monarchies. The promise of cold, stale pizza and the collective misery of multivariable calculus p-set collaboration proved a stronger draw than my existential physics crisis. It’s comforting, in a strange way, to know we’re all in this together, even if "this" means feeling perpetually one step behind.

Anyway, off to conquer more mathematical mountains. Wish me luck, diary. I might need a sultan's ransom just to afford enough caffeine to get through the weekend.
