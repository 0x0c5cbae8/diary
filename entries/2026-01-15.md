Dear diary,

2026-01-15 (Thursday)

My brain feels like it’s been put through a cosmic particle accelerator today. Just when I thought I’d finally wrapped my head around the nuances of Noether's Theorem for Dr. Feynman’s mechanics class (or at least, the version of it we’re tackling in Ph 11), a new wave of E&M problems crashed into my desktop. It's only Thursday, and I'm already calculating how many hours of sleep I'll sacrifice between now and the Friday 5 PM deadline. The answer is usually 'not enough'.

Tonight, the common room in Avery was a war zone of whiteboard markers, half-eaten pizza, and the desperate murmur of highly intelligent people questioning every life choice that led them to Caltech. We were all huddled around, trying to crack the infamous Problem 6 from the E&M p-set – something about a time-varying magnetic field inducing currents in a complex circuit with, naturally, an absurd number of components.

This is where the "relay" comes in. It's an unspoken rule, a survival mechanism here. Max had a breakthrough on part (a), the initial flux calculation. He practically *relayed* the concept to Chloe and me, frantically drawing diagrams and explaining the vector potential in a way that suddenly, mercifully, made sense. Then Chloe, who always seems to grasp the integration steps like magic, took Max's initial setup and *relayed* her derivation, simplifying the mess into something manageable. I then had to take their combined understanding and *relay* it into solving for the induced EMF using the specific boundary conditions given for part (c). It's a continuous chain, a mental hand-off of understanding, where each person builds on the last, pushing towards the final solution. Without that collective intellectual *relay*, I swear half of us would just give up and declare ourselves art history majors. (Just kidding, mostly).

And it's not just the p-sets. Earlier, during lab, we were troubleshooting a particularly finicky experimental setup, and the current kept cutting out. Turned out to be a slightly loose wire on an actual electrical *relay* within the circuit. It was a bizarre moment of life imitating art imitating... well, physics. I spent twenty minutes wiggling the wire, thinking about how my own brain cells felt like tiny, sputtering relays, trying to complete a circuit of coherent thought.

Now, it’s past 2 AM. The p-set is *mostly* done, thanks to the collective intellectual relay team. My eyes are burning, and I can practically feel the static electricity crackling off my hair. Time for a quick run to the Page House coffee pot for one last caffeine jolt before trying to get some sleep. The relay of consciousness will resume tomorrow, I'm sure.
